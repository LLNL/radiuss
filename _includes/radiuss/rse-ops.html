Research Software Engineering is becoming increasingly more complex in terms of technology and the need for communication between teams needing to work in both high performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing environments. This challenge would be well addressed by a movement to better define concepts around DevOps for High Performance Computing, and identify best practices and tools used in this space. We have vision for "<a href="https://rse-ops.github.io/landscape/" target="_blank">RSE-ops</a>," or Research Software Engineering Operations, a movement to mirror DevOps, best practices to bridge development and operations in typically cloud communities, and provide structure for better collaboration and navigation of the space.
