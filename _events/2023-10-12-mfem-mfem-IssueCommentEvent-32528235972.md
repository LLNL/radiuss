<small>Just a note: I accidentally force pushed a minor change to https://github.com/mfem/mfem/pull/3919 (that branch is not yet `in-review`) but this PR, which is `in-review`, is based on it. So, this PR is now showing also the revised commit from #3919. For the purposes of review, this PR is only to include `https://github.com/mfem/mfem/pull/3920/commits/134ac9821660213ef2c9e9c1076c63f25ab4fe12`. I can resolve the changes by merging but I think it will be easier to just rebase this on top of the updated #3919....</small>
