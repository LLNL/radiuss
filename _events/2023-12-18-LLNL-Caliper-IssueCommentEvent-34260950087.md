<small>The available counters don't really depend on the PAPI version but more on what is implemented for the given architecture. However `PAPI_TOT_CYC` is usually a pretty reliable one, so I'm kinda surprised it doesn't work, especially since it's available on any other Intel CPU so far. Oh well. Let's just disable PAPI on poodle for now....</small>
