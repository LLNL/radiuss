<small>Yeah, I guess that's true... When I first read it, my initial thought was to run the RAJAPerf tests on the branch that was going to be merged into develop, but it did not occur to me that github merge requests and gitlab were separate... Which is indeed an issue. Sounds like the original solution that was implemented would probably work just fine for this use case, as it always runs the RAJAPerf tests on the develop branch. ...</small>
