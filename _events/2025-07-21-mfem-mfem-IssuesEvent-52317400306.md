<p>Strange strong scaling results for the setup phase of LORSolver<HypreAMS></p><small>I have been running some experiments with LOR and I am seeing some strange scalability results for the setup phase. The problem size is 184,960,160 and I am using 32, 64, 128, ..., and 8192 processes. With less than 1024 processes, the scalability seems to be quite good, even better than the ideal linear speedup. However, for numbers greater than 1024 processes, the scalability drops significantly....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4888' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
