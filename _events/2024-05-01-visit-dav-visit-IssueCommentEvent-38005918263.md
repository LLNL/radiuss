<small>I did some quick tests on my laptop with a dir with 20,000 `.silo` and `.txt` files in it. Launching from within the dir (using terminal command) and browsing to the dir from a click-the-icon launch showed little difference in performance. Less than a 2 second delay in both cases. Though I think with file grouping set to off, its a little worse....</small>
