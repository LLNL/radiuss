<small>> Is this the right solution? Would it not be better instead to make `rust` a virtual package that can either be provided by `rust` (built from source) or `rust-bootstrap`? This puts the resolution closer to the source of the problem and doesn't require potentially all `rust` dependents to implement this....</small>
