<small>Execution spaces: support for memory backends and execution policies (#543)

* added memory backends specification

* mem backend in RAJA vec

* added Transfer Implementation for Umpire memory backend

* instrumented RAJA vector class to use the new backend

* removed unnecessary const from some testing methods

* implementation of memory backends

* raja vector fully ported to the new abstract backends

* allocators for Cpp and Cuda memory

* Hardware backend in Cuda Csr

* reorg: new directory and names for execution backends

* added cmake files for ExecBackends

* split raja vector into impl .h and cuda .cpp

* close to final design of exec spaces

* blended in mem backends with exec policies backends

* RAJA Exec Policies (cuda, hip) in separate impl .hpp files

* removed hiop_raja_defs.hpp

* renamed exec space member variable, added explicit template instantiations

* test for cuda condensed linear algebra temporary disabled when RAJA is not present

* fixed compilation errors (CUDA without RAJA)

* cuda execution policies: members for block sizes

* changed csr kernels to take block size as arguments (not the whole exec policies class)

* updated documentation and added draft of the new options (+documentation)

* adding openmp raja

* StdCpp mem backend compatible with Umpire "HOST"

* added HIP implementation vector file

* implemented memory backend for hip

* removed hiopVectorRajaPar

* addressing issues with OpenMP builds

* memory allocators supports array size types as template parameters

* cleaning up LinAlgFactory (name changed)

* implemented memory transfers between Hip and Umpire memory backends

* added install headers for exe backend</small>
