<small>Note `spack clean -d` currently (outside of this PR) removes downloaded sources (i.e. the tarball with the source used to build a package): users may not want to do this as part of refreshing their included files (if I understand, this is required to get the latest instance of a remote config, and otherwise the user would be working with a stale copy if the remote has been updated)....</small>
