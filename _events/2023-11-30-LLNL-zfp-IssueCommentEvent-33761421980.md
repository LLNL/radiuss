<small>> Just bumping the version is of course easy enough. However, assuming we'd release what's currently on `develop`, this branch has a fair number of commits since the last 1.0.0 release. Some additions may or may not yet be rigorously tested, documented, or even complete, and it would take some time to go through them to ensure `develop` is in a releasable state. I don't have time for that this week, but I'm hoping to work on it next week....</small>
