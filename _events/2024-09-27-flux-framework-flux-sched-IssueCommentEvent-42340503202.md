<small>We should get the PR out ASAP. There must be some resource type string that isn’t held persistently, and some rare race that allows it to be reaped and then hashed. If we could figure out what resource type that is, we could create a jobspec that can’t run or something and just keep it around as a workaround, but without knowing that getting this out is the best bet....</small>
