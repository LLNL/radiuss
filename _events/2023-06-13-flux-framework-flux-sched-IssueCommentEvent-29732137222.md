<small>@grondo, do you happen to have a testcase or reproducer that will produce this, or the original, issue? I'm looking over the code, and I think we must be having an issue with order of init or config or something, because the queue map is definitely populated in the normal path and load order, so something must change when we're in restart that sched doesn't expect....</small>
