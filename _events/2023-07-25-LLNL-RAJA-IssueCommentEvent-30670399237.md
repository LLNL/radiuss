<small>Actually, all RAJA::forall and most RAJA::kernel and RAJA::launch features are supported in the develop branch. SYCL reduction support is being developed in https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/tree/feature/homerdin/sycl_reduction. Parallel scans and sorts are not available yet.  Available execution policies, etc. for SYCL are described in the RAJA User Guide....</small>
