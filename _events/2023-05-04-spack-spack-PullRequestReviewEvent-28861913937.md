<small>I'm ok with this change. I'm not sure there's really a preference for flag_handler over setup_build_environment, and in any case we set other flags through arguments in configure_args so maybe we need to treat all that for increased consistency, but in a separate PR. Let's get this approved, merged, and the package fixed first....</small>
