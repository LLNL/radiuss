<small>@pazner I had been seeming some issues with convergence rates for a particular problem of mine, that were resolved when I went to very large penalty parameter (~10^8). I'm now more suspecting that there is something else wrong that is forcing the use of such a large parameter. I'll come back here if I can't figure it out, thank you!...</small>
