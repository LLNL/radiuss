<small>CachedCMakePackage: add CUDA/HIP options and improve independent builds (#37592)

* Add CMake options for building with CUDA/HIP support to
  CachedCMakePackages (intended to reduce duplication across packages
  building with +hip/+cuda and using CachedCMakePackage)
* Define generic variables like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for
  CachedCMakePackages (so that a user may invoke "cmake" themselves
  without needing to setthem on the command line).
* Make `lbann` a CachedCMakePackage.
