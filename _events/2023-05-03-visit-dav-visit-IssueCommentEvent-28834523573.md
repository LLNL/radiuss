<small>FYI...when the change is made to reduce to just sha256, I think it also makes sense to ensure the associated `.txt` files for this and also for sizes file that get wrapped up in the release include the version number of the release in their name. That is instead of `visit_sha256_checksums.txt` and `visit_filesizes.txt` adjust names to be `visit3_3_3_sha256_checksums.txt` and `visit3_3_3_filesizes.txt`. These and `INSTALL_NOTES` are the only release assets that are not also identified with the VisIt version number they are associated with....</small>
