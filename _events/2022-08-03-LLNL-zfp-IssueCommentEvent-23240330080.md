<small>@data-panda No, this release does not include the latest CUDA and HIP work we have been doing.  That will end up in the next release.

We've had discussions with others who have looked at this (see [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-07312-0_1), for instance) and would welcome a contribution....</small>
