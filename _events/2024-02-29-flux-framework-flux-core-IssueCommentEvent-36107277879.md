<small>I don't think that this issue (and https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/2204) made it into my production RM features list, but I was thinking about it this week due to a 16 node job on tioga not being released due to one node stuck in epilog. If it's something that would be reasonably easy to implement, it would be nice to have. If it's not easy, it should probably stay lower priority than other things. We need to fix the thing that's hanging in the epilog anyway....</small>
