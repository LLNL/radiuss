<small>oh crud, I just noticed that `libjob` implements a `sign_none_unwrap()` function to deal with when `flux-core` is not built with `flux-security`.  That's probably not something we want to re-implement in python.  hmmmm.  Maybe we should try to export `unwrap_string()` in some way....</small>
