<small>> @pelesh I tried this problem with MA57 and it seems the outer iterative refinement is not required. Seems to me ginkgo requires iterative refinement and something returns nan. Can you set `verbosity_level 7` and show me the log file? In addition, can you set `ir_outer_maxit 0` and rerun this failed case?...</small>
