<small>Vendor `typing_extensions`

We are using more and more typing features in Spack, and without features like
protocols, typing core is becoming harder and harder.

I think it's worth vendoring `typing_extensions` for this. It will get us a number of
useful capabilities:

* `Literal`
* `TypedDict`
* `Protocol`

among others.
