<p>RAJA Local Reduce?</p><small>So, I've got a reduction like the below where I need to be able to do a local reduction. I was hoping to maybe leverage RAJA launch for the kernel I had related to this as it seemed like potentially a natural fit. However, I'm having trouble finding if there's something akin to a `RAJA::LocalReduce` that could abstract this away or how I might encode that tree-based reduction within a RAJA thread group. Unfortunately, the normal RAJA::reduce types are a no-go for me just due to the sheer size of the array being assigned that local reduction. As I mentioned to @artv3 worse comes to worse I can always fall back to a less efficient algorithm if need be for the time being....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/issues/1816' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
