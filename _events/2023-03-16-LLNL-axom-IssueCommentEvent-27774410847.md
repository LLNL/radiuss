<small>Some of it is covered in `sidre/docs/sphinx/parallel_io_concepts.rst` but there's nothing pointing people there saying "This is for restart."  Also it doesn't cover the more complicated usage patterns such as the multi-step process for external data.  An example that really looks like a restart in the middle of a calculation and not just a static save/load equivalence would be good as well....</small>
