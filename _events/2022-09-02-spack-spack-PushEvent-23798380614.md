<small>Apply hip workaround for raja-framework (#32469)

* add workaround for broken behavior in HIP

Hip has a longstanding cmake issue where they calculate include paths
incorrectly, this works around it for raja and adds an explicit rocprim
dependency.

* propagate openmp requirement and workaround to camp

* refactor and include umpire

* propagate openmp option to camp in umpire and use main camp for main and develop raja and umpire

* bump camp to new patch release</small>
