<small>> I would not go so far as to say that. If the lower-bandwidth approximation contains "sufficient" information from the Jacobian so that the preconditioned matrix is well-conditioned, then it could be effective. I'll note that these banded preconditioners for CVODE and ARKODE are typically used on problems where the true Jacobian bandwidth exceeds the preconditioner bandwidth; their effectiveness in such situations is rather problem-dependent....</small>
