<small>Our MOAB collaborators could benefit from this so I am pulling out of the reviewed state. The basic idea is that when a user selects a file in the list of files, the GUI can adjust the list of plugins that show in the `Open file as type` pull down so that it shows *matching* plugins *first* and if there is only a single match, it selects that option too....</small>
