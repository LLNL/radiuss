<small>> > @rrsettgast - this is a problem with GCC and CUDA 10, fixed in CUDA 11. The correct workaround is to add the flag `-Xcompiler -mno-float128` to your CUDA compile flags. We already have the workaround for this in RAJA: https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt#L92...</small>
