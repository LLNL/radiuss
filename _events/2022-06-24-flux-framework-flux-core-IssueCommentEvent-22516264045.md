<small>> My opinion shouldn't matter much here, but I don't find it likely that the KVS sync and heartbeat sync would be confused. I mean the KVS sync related flag is FLUX_KVS_SYNC right not just FLUX_SYNC? It makes sense that the term sync might be used differently in different contexts....</small>
