<small>@rhornung67 I don't think it timed out actually, I think it just failed for some other reason. It failed in 14min 30 sec, but the timeout limit is 3 hours. Unfortunately, because of all of the compiler warnings, GitLab is truncating the output, so I can't actually see what the problem is. I think I might make a branch off of this one for the compiler warnings and fix some of them, just so I can actually see what the issue is that's killing it in the CI.   ...</small>
