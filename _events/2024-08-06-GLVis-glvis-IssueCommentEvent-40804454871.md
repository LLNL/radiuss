<small>While we have all this `glvis` momentum can we get eyes on https://github.com/GLVis/pyglvis/pull/44 so we can merge :). This can be after the `glvis` release of course. There will be other changes needed for `pyglvis` (such as updating the `glvis-js` version hosted on `npm`), but it will be nice to test with the rewrite....</small>
