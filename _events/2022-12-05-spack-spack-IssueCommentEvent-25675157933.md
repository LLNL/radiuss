<small>@jpbrodsky While trying to reproduce this failure, I have a build failure with vgm that a bit of searching would indicate is from using a newer clang with an older gcc ends up with a libstdc++ that is missing some more recent C++ features.  How did you get past this so I know that I'm building the same way you are to figure out this issue....</small>
