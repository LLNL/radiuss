<small>>  The testsuite is made to test the build directory, so there is no need to make install. There is actually a target make check-prep that will prep the builddir for testing so you do not have to run a full make check. You can then go into the t directory and run tests by hand. I usually use the -d -v flags to get full debug output and keep the "trash directory" around for analysis....</small>
