<small>I think your understanding is complete.  We haven't observed double bookings with Fluxion (at least not since you fixed that other bug) because flux-core doesn't do partial release now and in fact it's not allowed by RFC 21.  It was prototyped in flux-framework/flux-core#5818 but I only tested with sched-simple since I knew Fluxion would not handle it....</small>
