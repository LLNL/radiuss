<p>NURBS autoedge seems to rely on the ordering of vertex ids</p><small>Hello, I am attempting to write out NURBS to the MFEM NURBS mesh format, specifically I am trying the "autoedge" variant, as shown in miniapps/nurbs/meshes/two-cubes-nurbs-autoedge.mesh and miniapps/nurbs/meshes/two-squares-nurbs-autoedge.mesh.  I am getting the "Inconsistent edge-to-knotvector mapping" error found in mesh/nurbs.cpp:2947 when I try to load mesh files I am generating.  I am testing this on a re-creation of two-cubes-nurbs-autoedge.mesh exported from my code, and have narrowed down all the differences between the file in the repo and my generated file to a permutation of the vertex ids. diff between my file and two-cubes-nurbs-autoedge.mesh gives the following:...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4915' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
