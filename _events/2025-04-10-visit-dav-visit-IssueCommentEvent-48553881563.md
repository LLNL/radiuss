<small>The other thing left is to fix is the data layout transform. The issue there is I'm unsure whether the 2D example dataset has the correct metadata for its data layout, or whether the Paraview reader also has a bug, since the particles and mesh data are not rendered in the same plane in Paraview. @ax3l Do you have an update on this?...</small>
