<small>The issue is that the payload returned from `job-list` is not as useful as the `JobInfo` class, which makes a lot more user friendly attributes of a job available to the user (and are created on demand). The `JobInfo` class is probably what most users should use IMO (as I think that's true for Python in general, not every Python class is just a dict right?)...</small>
