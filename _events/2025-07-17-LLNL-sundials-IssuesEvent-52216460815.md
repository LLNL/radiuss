<p>How thorough is the scaling in KINSOL?</p><small>[Section 7.2.4.](https://sundials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kinsol/Mathematics_link.html#scaling) of the Kinsol documentation describes how to introduce scaling factors in the solution of nonlinear systems. From the documentation is clear that the weights are used in the definition of all the norms used, e.g., for iteration termination criteria, as well as for the calculations of the perturbations used to compute numerical Jacobians by finite differences....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/743' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
