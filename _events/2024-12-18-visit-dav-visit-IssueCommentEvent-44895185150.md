<small>Hi @markcmiller86; I didn't try with `-nowin` just yet. I am currently narrowing down the cause of this by using the fresh session file from the user and iteratively making changes with python that lead towards the state of my session file, and saving out images each step of the way. I've narrowed it down to some change in the rendering attributes, but that was as far as I got today. I'll pick it back up again tomorrow....</small>
