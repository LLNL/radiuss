<small>Would this procedure help for users; https://github.com/tomodian/release#macos-developer-cannot-be-verified-error ? I am not a macos user, so I don't really know how that should be handled in a spack package (or why it doesn't affect other packages; though presumably because this is a binary). The package could provide some hints. Does this only happen for binary blobs? Not sure why `google-cloud-cli` isn't affected......</small>
