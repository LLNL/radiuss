<small>@pazner Thank you for the elegant example repo. I like this approach and think it could work for MFEM. Conveniently, we would not need to change the use of `fptype`. We would just need to define `fptype` like `fp` in your repo. So the modification to this PR would be much less than 14k lines....</small>
