<small>Hi @victorapm .  I still need to review this, but I started to think a bit more about using cmake as my default build option when writing code.  It's a bit cumbersome to use right out of the box right now, so I thought we could discuss this more at our next meeting.  I added an agenda item.  Also, I added a draft idea in commit https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/pull/1181/commits/9179d218a55c0b80a800332ee16388d6bc40b780 that copies the executables (in test or examples) to the original source directory to aid with testing.  We can chat about this too....</small>
