<small>@adrienbernede it should be addressed by this patch: https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs/blob/main/packages/fmt/fmt-no-variable-initialize_10.0.0.patch but doesn't look like it's getting applied for IBM Clang 14.0.5: https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs/blob/main/packages/fmt/package.py#L97...</small>
