<small>> Allowing validate-only plugins is certainly a value-add, but I wonder if we need another class for this, or if we can just make all of the plugin options except prog named (optional) class attributes. I might try this today and see how it works out. This, however, wouldn't allow one plugin to supply multiple options, which might be useful....</small>
