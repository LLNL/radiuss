<small>@alalazo Your suggestion to use tuples didn't work as expected, see comment above (https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/34375#discussion_r1051013026). I reverted to my original approach. I also had to add commit https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/34375/commits/de92afb9dc3dd8be701c291bd04cabe4c23abe60 to avoid situations where `install_name_tool` would try to add the same `rpath` twice, and it doesn't like that....</small>
