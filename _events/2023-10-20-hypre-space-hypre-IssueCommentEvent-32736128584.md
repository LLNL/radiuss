<small>Hi @ulrikeyang .  Thanks for getting this ready again.  I am confused about the break logic relative to the documentation.  Maybe I'm misreading this, and if so, my apologies.  I seemed to think this was correct the first time I reviewed it because it's exactly the same.  Let me know.  Thanks!...</small>
