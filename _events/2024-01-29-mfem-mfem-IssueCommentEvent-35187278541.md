<small>Thanks @atallah727! I wasn't aware that the Lagrange multiplier could be determined from the Nitsche-based solution of the PDE, but that makes sense. I am interested in determining a Lagrange multiplier in the context of an optimization problem, so having the Lagrange multiplier be explicitly present in the problem is important....</small>
