<small>I guess I was just thinking probably the main reasons to resubmit were things in the environment that went wrong, like a bad node, and that running the same exact thing again was likely to produce the same failure otherwise.  But yeah, perhaps something to clarify with the user.  Maybe could support either (afternotok vs afterexcepti?)...</small>
