<small>Thanks for your reply @kennyweiss . I already used it as a public function in my project now. I fully agree with your point that the current usage of `Polyhedron::getFaces()` is a bit awkard, and this is why I submitted this issue. It would be nice if an elegant usage can be provided in the future....</small>
