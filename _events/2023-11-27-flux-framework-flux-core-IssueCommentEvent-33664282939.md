<small>Oh, yeah. Actually that directory of links could be useful in other situations to encapsulate a set of executables we want to push first in path within an instance, though at this point I could go either way on this and if you prefer linking to `bindir` instead of select executables under `rundir` then I'm fine with that for now (e.g. if it is actually simpler.)...</small>
