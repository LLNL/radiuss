<small>I proposed the move to cmake in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/42766 because the mixing of autotools and cmake causes problems where cmake would use a system cmake netcdf-c instead of the autotools netcdf-c or vice versa. I had not noticed the discrepancy in library names, but I also don't use hard-coded library names (which, imo, should always be avoided). ...</small>
