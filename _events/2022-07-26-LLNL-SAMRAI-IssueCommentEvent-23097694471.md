<small>I found a place where SAMRAI is computing strictly increasing tag values where I think that reusing constant values will be entirely safe.  It is possible that these values are eventually reaching the upper bound on your systems with smaller upper bounds.  #209 has a preliminary fix, if you would like to try it....</small>
