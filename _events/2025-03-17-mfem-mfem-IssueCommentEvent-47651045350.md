<small>Great results! 👍 The winning stage is split for me 🥇 , HRT and HDG results are very close. The port errors of HDG look ugly, but it is a known problem of DG, where we do not have an essential boundary condition and they are not harmful overall. HRT shows some extra artifacts, which is rather worrying to me....</small>
