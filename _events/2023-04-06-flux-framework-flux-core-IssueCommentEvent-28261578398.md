<small>I stumbled on this typos tool a few years ago - and I can confirm it's gotten better as time has passed. And yes it's really addictive - when I first add to a repository I can spend an hour or so fixing all the typos! But it's really satisyfing when it's all done, and I can rest assured I'm protecting future me from spelling mistakes....</small>
