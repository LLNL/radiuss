<small>@pshriwise Apologies that this slipped under my radar. I've implemented a ray tracing routine using mfem for arbitrary convex polyhedra. It is not very mature yet (probably won't abstract cleanly out of my code, and does not yet make use of the mfem device interface) but I can add you to the repository to see if it may be useful as a starting point. The most relevant functions live in the 'traversal' object, and the most recent version is on the 'c5g7' branch....</small>
