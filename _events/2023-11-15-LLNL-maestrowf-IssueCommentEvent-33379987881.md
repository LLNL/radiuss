<small>I think I'm probably going to drop working on this for now, at least until someone else requests the example to work again, because it's one workflow of (a potential) many that would be nice to have working as it did before, but shouldn't block to working on other things. Let's leave the issue open in case anyone else has insights. Thanks for the help @jwhite242 !...</small>
