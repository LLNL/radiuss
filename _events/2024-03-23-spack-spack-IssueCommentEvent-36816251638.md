<small>I'm not too familiar with the HIP toolchain, but what's the point of this package when` llvm-amdgpu `exists? Especially since the [README](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPCC/blob/develop/README.md) for hipcc mentions its a deprecated read-only mirror of `llvm-amdgpu`. Does it fix some issue that requires using the hipcc driver versus compiling with an application using amdclang++?  Or is it just to ease compiling with HIP?...</small>
