<small>I’ll rebase to it, no problem there. Maybe that by itself will change the linking issues, but there were symbols in several of them that came from czmq (without linking it) libjob and others. Will send something easier to reproduce if it keeps up after the rebase I suppose, though one simple way to see what’s missing would be to turn off the flag that allows undefined symbols and see what blows up....</small>
