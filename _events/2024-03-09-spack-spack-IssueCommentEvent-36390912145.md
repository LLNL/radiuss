<small>@adamjstewart lemme just join in and say thanks or making Spack what it is today. Here's the contributor graph of all the lines in Spack packages by author. Adam's been the top package contributor since 2017 or earlier. We wouldn't have X11, many of the ML packages, the Python ecosystem, or many more parts of Spack without him.  Also, he contributed a lot of these things at times when the package ecosystem was much smaller than it is today. These days, you can expect that many of your dependencies are already in Spack. When @adamjstewart started, you couldn't, and it was people like him who lowered the barrier for everyone else by adding all the fundamentals....</small>
