<p>Improve the error handling for most solvers</p><small>Most MFEM implemented solvers handle errors using `MFEM_VERIFY` and `MFEM_ASSERT`. Solver::`Mult (const Vector &x, Vector &y)` is a void function. When one solver is used as the precondition for another, the error in precondition solving won't be propagated to the outer solving process. So, the outer main solver will continue without error handling, while it's expected to return or stop early....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4813' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
