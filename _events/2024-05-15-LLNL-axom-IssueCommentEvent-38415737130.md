<small>@rhornung67  - Adding a full-blown axom::numeric_limits<> sounds useful to me. I wasn't really aware of that work in #1196 so I used a related axom::numerics::floating_point_limits<>::max() function that was in the code today. I changed the numeric_limits in 2 places that were marked AXOM_HOST_DEVICE....</small>
