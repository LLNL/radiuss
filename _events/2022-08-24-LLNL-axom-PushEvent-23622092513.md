<small>[set-devirt-expt] Map: use PolyValue for stored Set

* The Map set-pointer constructor has been replaced with a constructor
  that accepts a PolyValue<Set>. Existing calls with a Set pointer
  should still work, as long as that pointer is of concrete Set type.
* Maps instantiated with a concrete, non-abstract set may no longer use
  the set-pointer/PolyValue<Set> constructor.</small>
