<small>> I'm having issue linking one of our codes against this (segfault). I might be in the code itself, it might be in this new library. Can we hold off merging this until this linking issue is solved. Also if any of you could try to link your favorite code against this and run a few sina-enabled examples that would be great. Thx!...</small>
