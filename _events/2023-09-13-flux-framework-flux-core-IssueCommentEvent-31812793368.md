<small>Yeah, I'd second a vote for keeping the original R/jobspec in the KVS and building the "current" R/jobspec by applying job events and with a replay on a restart.  The "job schema" just makes more sense to me this way.  If R were updated in place, then the update events in the eventlog would not have a context to be meaningful....</small>
