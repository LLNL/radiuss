<small>So if I'm understanding correctly, PySide has never officially supported 3.5+, and 1.2.4 explicitly adds a check to enforce this, but 1.2.2 works fine. I'm guessing the "issue" is the `subprocess.mswindows` thing I patched below. I bet if you remove that version check 1.2.4 will work as well....</small>
