<small>Hi @kimo707. SUNDIALS does not provide a MATLAB interface at this time. Is there a reason you can't use the built-in MATLAB function [`ode15i`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode15i.html)? I'll note that [Octave](https://octave.org/), an open source MATLAB alternative, uses IDA for its implementation of `ode15s` and `ode15i`. Otherwise, you may need a third-party tool or custom mex files to call IDA from MATLAB....</small>
