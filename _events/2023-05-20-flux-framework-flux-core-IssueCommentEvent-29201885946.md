<small>The failure I observed in the `t0034-flub.t` sharness test was in the last test a "connection timed out" error from `flux overlay status` while waiting for the instance to be come `full` again.  I really don't quite understand what caused that and I've been unable to reproduce it since.  I did push some changes to tests to reduce redundancy and to use the `flux uri --local` URI instead of the ssh:// one.  Anyway, maybe everything is fine. :shrug:...</small>
