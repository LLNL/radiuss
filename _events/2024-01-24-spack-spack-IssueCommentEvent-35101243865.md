<small>> In this case, the system Python (`/usr/bin/python3`) works great, it's Homebrew Python that breaks everything. Note that Spack is still installing its own Python in the DAG, the issue is with the Python used to run the Spack executable. Anyway, just mentioning this in case anyone else runs into this issue (_ahem_, future me) and maybe this will be a potential fix for them....</small>
