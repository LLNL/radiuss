<small>That looks pretty good.  I'm working back through older emails today and saw the previous few all together.  If it makes it easier, we could also use something like a prefix argument, think `-Wl`, so the flags would be normal in the plugin but would only be valid either immediately after a `--plugin` or `--ext` or similar or even as a comma-separated string.  The prefixes work fine too, but it's easier to transition them later and keep the old support if the actual name the code handles isn't changing....</small>
