<small>@homerdin I don't know which specific compiler and version that produced the error. If you have access to it, will you please try to build the code in the branch associated with this PR: https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/pull/1668 or have someone at Intel(?) try that branch.  The change I made resolves the issue in the Compiler Explorer example for every compiler I tried there.  ...</small>
