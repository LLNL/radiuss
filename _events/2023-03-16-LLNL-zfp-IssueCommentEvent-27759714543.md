<small>Hi, I'm happy to create (another) post release with updated wheels from you, but want to be confident that we don't create other problems. Ideally we want wheels which work with _every_ supported version of numpy, so does building with a newer numpy mean it is still possible to use the wheels with an older numpy? Or is there a way to insist on the "oldest-supported-numpy" being a minimum version?...</small>
