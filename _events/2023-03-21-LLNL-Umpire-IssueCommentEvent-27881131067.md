<small>Needed for https://github.com/wdmapp/gtensor/pull/257. For gtensor, I try to always support the latest public oneapi release, and make some effort to support the previous release. I am not sure it is worth the effort to support older releases, as there are major improvements in each release and they are often required to take advantage of the emerging Intel HPC class GPUs....</small>
