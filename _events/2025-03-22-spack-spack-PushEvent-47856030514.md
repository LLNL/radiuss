<small>concretizer: don't use clingo.Symbol for setup

Since we moved from creating clingo symbols directly to constructing a pure string
representation of the program, we don't need to make `AspFunctions` into symbols before
turning them into strings. We can just write strings like clingo would.

This cuts about 25% off the setup time by avoiding an unnecessary round trip.

- [x] create strings directly from `AspFunctions`
- [x] remove unused `symbol()` method on `AspFunction`
- [x] setup no longer tries to call `symbol()`
