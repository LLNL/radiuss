<small>I think Debug mode will be horrendously slow for this case. Perhaps some more targeted debuting via `printf` statements are in order here? Maybe start with the `insertNonZero` and everything "finer" that. It will be a bit of a mess, but you stand a better chance than with a debug run at 1/4 frontier scale....</small>
