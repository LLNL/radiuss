<small>@kmittal2 is the transform supposed to work on one unit cell? Or I need to refine the mesh? For example, how can I generate the figure in the PR? I tried to play with `ref-cube.mesh` and I can get something like your figure after a few refinement, but it is as smooth as yours. Maybe I just need to refine more?...</small>
