<small>@brugger1 @markcmiller86 For the MOAB plugin, you can use `--disable-fortran` and either `--download-eigen3` or `--with-eigen3=$EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR` to use Eigen3 as a dependency instead of BLAS/LAPACK. Please let me know if that resolves the issue. Please feel free to tag me as well in the future....</small>
