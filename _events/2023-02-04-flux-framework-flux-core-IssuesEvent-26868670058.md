<p>job-list: refactor, split out jobspec / R parsing into individual testable library</p><small>per comments in #4555.  Note that this could be in `libutil` b/c this is generally useful.  Very likely could be used in other places, like `job-manager`, `job-exec`, maybe `job-ingest`?  Maybe `sched-simple`?  Likely in future places....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4592' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
