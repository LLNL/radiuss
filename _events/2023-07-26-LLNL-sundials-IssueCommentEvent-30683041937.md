<small>Next version of Scilab (2024.0 in october) will give access to almost all SUNDIALS solvers (idas will be interfaced later) and preview builds are available here: https://www.utc.fr/~mottelet/scilab_for_macOS.html. I have started porting the gateways code for Nelson a few month ago but I had to focus on Scilab release this spring and summer....</small>
