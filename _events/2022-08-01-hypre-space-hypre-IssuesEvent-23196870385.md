<p>AMG performance scaling problems</p><small>Hi! I'm integrating Hypre into my PDE solver based on [TNL](https://tnl-project.org/) and although it works, I'm observing quite poor performance scaling with the Hypre's AMG solver. To demonstrate this, I also ran a benchmark using the [ex5](https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/blob/master/src/examples/ex5.c) example (modified to include timers around the `HYPRE_ParCSRPCGSetup` and `HYPRE_ParCSRPCGSetup` calls):...</small><a href='https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/issues/691' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
