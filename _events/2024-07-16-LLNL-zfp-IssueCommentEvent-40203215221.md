<small>@svdree-shell Thank you so much for this contribution--we've been wanting to support this capability for some time.  Unfortunately, as also discussed on PR #232, this is not a great time to merge CUDA/HIP PRs due to extensive changes already being made to the GPU implementations on the `staging` branch.  Let me revisit this PR once our work on `staging` has been merged into `develop`....</small>
