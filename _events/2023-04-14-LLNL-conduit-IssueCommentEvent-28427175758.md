<small>Thank you, I just tried it after running 'rm -rf spack.lock .spack*' in my environment as well as deleting and recloning the whole spack directory (to make sure it downloads the new version of conduit and not something cached). But it seems to get the same omp error. Do you know if there is a way to check if it is for sure downloading the newest version? ...</small>
