<p>How to compile a single example</p><small>I'm very new to MFEM. I see how to install mfem directly or through spack. The examples or miniapps are build with "make examples" or "make miniapps". However, i don't see how to cmake && make a single program and wrote a coressponding CMakeList. Any hints on that? (Should MFEM be pointed to libmfem.a in CMakeLists.txt?)...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4150' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
