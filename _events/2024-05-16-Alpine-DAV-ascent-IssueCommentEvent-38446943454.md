<small>In the above bad image, I was giving conduit/ascent only the connectivity for the surface elements, but it still had all the solution and coordinate information for the volume vertexes. I removed all that and left only those on the surface, purely to make the file exports smaller, but that seems to have inadvertently fixed the render issue so now it looks fine in parallel. ...</small>
