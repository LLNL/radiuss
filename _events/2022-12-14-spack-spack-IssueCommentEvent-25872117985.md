<small>Thanks! I'm not really a heavy OpenCV user either, I just use it for ML. I did a bit of digging and the best reference I could find was https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/13154. It may be deprecated, but it doesn't seem like there are immediate plans to remove it, it just isn't supported very well. The authors suggest using cmake instead, but obviously not everyone uses cmake, so it's unfortunate....</small>
