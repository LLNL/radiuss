<small>@rfalgout @victorapm , there is still a lot of rough/unfinished code in here for the unstructured interpolation pieces, but we had discussed getting this into recmat sooner rather than later, so I think this is an acceptable state to merge. I've done some testing to make sure I'm not changing behavior when unstructured interpolation is turned off, that is, you should get the same results as the base recmat branch if you don't use the new unstructured interpolation stuff....</small>
