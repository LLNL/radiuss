<small>You can use F9/F10 to cycle through the boundary attributes -- the output in the terminal will show which bdr attribute is currently shown. Another way is to load the mesh in the `mesh-explorer` miniapp in `miniapps/meshing` and then use menu option `b` to view the boundary attributes in different colors....</small>
