<small>I think the stronger reason for doing this in a separate repo is that it's complicated, not necessarily required by all or even most end users, and some specialized knowledge is needed to work on it.  OTOH,  adding more work before we can use this sucks, and I suppose we could always spin it off to another repo later, maybe when we've decided to go another way.  I guess I'm leaning toward the latter at this point....</small>
