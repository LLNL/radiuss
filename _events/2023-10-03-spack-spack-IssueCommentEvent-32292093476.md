<small>@sethrj I think there are a couple of use cases for this.  The one in which I'm primarily interested is in activating the tests so that I can run them after I use spack to configure/build, but not through spack (I want to use `ctest` directly).  Would that still work, or would enabling that (I assume with `--test root`) cause the tests to be run automatically?...</small>
