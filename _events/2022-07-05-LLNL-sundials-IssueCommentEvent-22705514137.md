<small>Since CVODE and ARKODE focus on ODE IVPs, e.g., $\dot{y}(t) = f(t,y(t))$, then the corresponding root-finding problems have Jacobians with the form $A = I - \gamma J$.  Due to the diagonal "$I$" matrix and the fact that $\gamma$ is proportional to the [typically small] time step size, then for some problems $A$ may be well-approximated by a banded (or banded block-diagonal) matrix....</small>
