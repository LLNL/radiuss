<small>@Raghavendra0117 if you look a the pulse while zooming you will see that the pulse is kind of chopped (one sample over two is zero. The pulse is supposed to be a soft curve, not chopped. On my side I am rewriting the code in python to find the proper implementation and validate the theoretical approach., then I will convert the C++ using MFEM. I have not succeed yet but once working I will share the codes and some results....</small>
