<small>@EdwardPalmer99, thanks for adding this. The code all looks good to me. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble running the unit tests for some reason. Everything builds fine and I see the new object file being linked into the `unit_tests` executable. However, the new test and tag names (as reported by `./unit_tests --list-tests` and `./unit_tests --list-tags`) do not seem to be available so I cannot verify that the new tests are being run....</small>
