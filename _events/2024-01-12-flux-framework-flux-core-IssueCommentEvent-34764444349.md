<small>@trws I had a little bit of time, and I poked around in various corners of the internet, searched my mac (in Finder, which shows `malloc.h` when I look for it), and downloaded the full version of XCode, and still can't manage to find the `link.h` header file. Do you have any hints on where that might be, or what I might need to get it?...</small>
