<small>openblas: fix bound :7.3 to :7.3.0 (#34443)

This patch:

https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2018-01/msg01962.html

is actually in Amazon Linux GCC 7.3.1, which we use in CI.

So we should not hold openblas back because of it.

Old versions of OpenBLAS fail to detect the host arch of some of the
AVX512 cpus of build nodes, causing build failures.

Of course we should try to set ARCH properly in OpenBLAS to avoid that
it looks up the build arch, but that's quite some work.</small>
