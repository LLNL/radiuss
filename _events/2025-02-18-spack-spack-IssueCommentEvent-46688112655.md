<small>The point is that compiling rust seeks to reach out to the internet during the compilation. We are working on machines that have government restrictions (FISMA high etc) that are air-gapped, where a security vetting must happen for each package and each new version of a package, and where the installation can only be done by authorized personnel and "usually" must be done from source.
