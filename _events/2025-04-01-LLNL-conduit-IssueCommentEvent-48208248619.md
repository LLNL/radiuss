<small>@cyrush @JustinPrivitera Thanks for your help. The similar mesh structure and fields are working fine when I pass them to ParaView Catalyst for in situ visualization. At this point, I am trying to create an example (or cookbook) for Python interaction in case of user just want to process the data using Python. That would be helpful especially environments without active Catalyst and/or ParaView installations. It would be also nice to have an example that pass data and MPI communicator to Python and process them Using Dask etc. Maybe have a Python module (or wrapper) that can be used by user to simplify these tasks and interaction with other Python modules. I think all these needs to be explored in my end. ...</small>
