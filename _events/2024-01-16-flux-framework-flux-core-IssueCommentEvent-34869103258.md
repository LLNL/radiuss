<small>Just curious, how are you going to match on hosts with older jobs in a database. Maybe the optimization won't be needed in that case if the hosts are indexed or something. (I haven't seen an implementation, so difficult to reason about). I assume a good database will have already handled the query optimization and "DoS" problem......</small>
