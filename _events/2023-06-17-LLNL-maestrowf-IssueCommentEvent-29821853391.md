<small>And to keep you in the loop, I've started my small repository of examples here: https://github.com/rse-ops/maestro-examples. I think a strategy I will advocate for is to run this inside of a container, and have all software dependencies ready to go! At least in a cloud context,  you want wait to wait for one build step to download and build something (akin to what lulesh does, unless it's really really fast!) But tonight is the first time I'm trying this out, so it's an early impression....</small>
