<small>@ngiulianiAMAT To clarify my earlier message: when I mentioned that complex support is mostly limited to Krylov solvers and not preconditioners, I meant that the solver (e.g., LOBPCG in your case) can be used without any preconditioner when working with complex numbers. At the moment, HYPRE doesnâ€™t support complex-valued preconditioners, so any setup using complex arithmetic would need to rely on an unpreconditioned solver....</small>
