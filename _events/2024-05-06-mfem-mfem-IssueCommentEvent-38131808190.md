<small>@v-dobrev please see my comment in #4280, the output metadata needs to reflect the type of field the user wants to see.  The mfem root file needs to state if the output is vertex associated (`nodes` -- this is a bad name, but it's the name we have used) or element associated (`elements`). It does not contain any other metadata about the true basis function, so we need this....</small>
