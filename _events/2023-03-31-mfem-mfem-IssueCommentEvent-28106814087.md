<small>For clarification, the actual bilinear operator matrix A is more complicated than (-1, .. -1, .., 4, ..., -1, ... -1), which is only a row for interior points. For boundary points the form is different since in ex0 the Dirichlet boundary condition is used. But my point is that it somehow missed a coefficient of triangle elment size, and this also applies to matrix rows related to boundary points....</small>
