<p>add completion/introspection helper to liboptparse</p><small>It would be nice if liboptparse had an introspection or completion helper option that let a caller query the subcommands and options available in a Flux command using optparse. Not only would this allow completions to be easily kept up-to-date, but would also be helpful in making a suggestion system for flux, e.g. if a user types `flux kill JOBID`, they might get `kill is not a flux command. Try flux job kill` or similar....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4953' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
