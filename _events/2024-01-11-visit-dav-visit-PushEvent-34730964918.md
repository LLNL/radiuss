<small>Fix problems with path-filtering in regression suite on Windows. (#19223) (#19224)

Added logic to handle cases where there are extra path-separator escapes when filtering paths in text to substitute VISIT_TOP_DIR.

Also reverted a change in Variant.C where unix-style paths were converted to Windows-style in 'EscapeQuotedString'.</small>
