<small>That brings up an interesting question. Should the image annotation object be on the local or remote system? It sounds like the current implementation is for it to be remote if in scalable rendering mode and local if rendering geometry in the viewer. This seems confusing. I don't know what the right answer is, but maybe some thought needs to go into figuring out what the right behavior should be....</small>
