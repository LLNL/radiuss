<small>Updated, now only `.spack` files will be cached and the checksum is verified before using a cached copy. To make it consistent, the checksum check is now in `download_tarball` instead of `extract_tarball` (except in the case of old-format buildcache files). I've also rearranged the code slightly to fit better with the current usage....</small>
