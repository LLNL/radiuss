<small>Hmm in the comments under the very stackexchange post you mentioned, it is said that SIPG, which I suppose is what is used by default in example 14, has convergence of the order $h^{p+1}$. This seems to come from Hartman 2008 [ "Numerical Analysis of Higher Order Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Methods"](https://elib.dlr.de/57074/1/Har08b.pdf), eq 264. So then even with $p=0$, first order convergence should be expected, right?...</small>
