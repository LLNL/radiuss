<small>I'm not sure. On the one hand we do get issues in the hotline from people who have been given some .bashrc from some other group member or code team and are confused by something in it, so I'm sure that there will be users who use custom configs without really understanding what they're doing and don't know where to look when things break. On the other hand, it seems like most users who get as far as editing a .toml, .yaml, or .json file are going to be fairly motivated/sophisticated and will remember that there are custom configurations even if they have to look up where they put them. Also, if they do forget, it's a pretty easy thing for support to check....</small>
