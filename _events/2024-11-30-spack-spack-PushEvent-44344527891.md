<small>`package_base`: generify accessor methods for `when`-keyed dictionaries

This turns some variant-specific methods for dealing with when-keyed dictionaries into
more generic versions, in preparation for conditional version definitions.

`_by_name`, `_names`, etc. are replaced with generic methods for transforming
when-keyed dictionaries:
 * `_by_subkey()`
 * `_subkeys()`
 * `_num_definitions()`
 * `_definitions()`
 * `_remove_overridden_defs()`

And the variant accessors are refactored to use these methods underneath.

To do this, types like `WhenDict` had to be generified, and some `TypeVars`
were added for sortable keys and values.
