<small>Of two proposed signatures in the description here, probably only the first one with the `load_group` second argument will be done.  This `load_group` would be a group that holds the external views that are going to be loaded.  Having an API to call this only on a group and not a view matches what is done in the core Sidre classes, where there is `loadExternalData` in the Group class but not in View....</small>
