<small>> Not sure of the best way to deal with this. If we had some type of comment field like NO_FLUX_PYTHON_BINDING, could sed/awk those functions away. Or could do some pre-processor trickery, like #ifdef NO_FLUX_BINDING and only define when we're doing the cffi magic (Edit: this is probably preferred, b/c we do a pre-processor step to generate the python bindings anyways)....</small>
