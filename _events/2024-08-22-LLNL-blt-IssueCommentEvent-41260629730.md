<small>This is an unfortunate case of several project wide things hitting each other. There could be different ways to fix this. I am a bit confused why unsetting that variable changes the example directory due to it being set to `bin` not `examples`.  Could you work around this by unsetting it before loading MFEM then setting it back? I can also help inperson or webex to dig into this....</small>
