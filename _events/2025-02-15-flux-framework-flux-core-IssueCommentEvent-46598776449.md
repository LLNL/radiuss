<small>There don't _appear_ to be duplicates in the eventlog in this case, since a subsequent `flux job attach` after the job is complete returns the expected output. I'm wondering if somehow `flux job attach` watches the output eventlog twice, or worse case `job-info` could be sending entry responses more than once? (Wasn't there some recent work in this area?)...</small>
