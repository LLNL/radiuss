<small>We should be able to do a **Mesh** plot of a curve. That might sound boring...at first...because its just a line (with maybe dots where segments join). Well, not if you think of curves as *paths*. In 2D a mesh plot of a curve overlayed with a related dataset would plot the path of that curve through the 2D topology of the dataset, showing the user where the two overlap. That seems very useful...even if the "curve" was just a line through the 2D data....</small>
