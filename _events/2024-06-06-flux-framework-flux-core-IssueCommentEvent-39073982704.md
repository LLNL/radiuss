<small>Oh,wait.  I guess probably the version of systemd I have isn't yet using `cgroup.kill` so systemd running as `flux` cant signal the shell running as `garlick`.  The SIGTERMs are forwarded by the IMP, and the SIGKILLs take the IMP out.  So back to the original idea of having the IMP iterate over the cgroup.  Sorry for the noise!...</small>
