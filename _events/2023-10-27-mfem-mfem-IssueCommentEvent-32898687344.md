<small>When TMOP runs, I'd like the boundary nodes to move tangentially to the arbitrary shape of the left, right, top, and bottom boundaries. So, if the domain is simply a box, the top nodes can move in the x-direction, but their movement follows the first derivative direction if the boundary is a curved shape....</small>
