<p>Suggestion : Adding safe versions of `Operator` functions.</p><small>Right now, `Operator::Mult(const Vector &x, Vector &y)` and related operations don't have guard rails to make sure that `x` and `y` are the right size. Some derived classes of `Operator` do their own verification, and some don't. This means that it's up to the users to make sure `x` and `y` have the right size by default unless they have extra knowledge of the derived class they're working with....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4358' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
