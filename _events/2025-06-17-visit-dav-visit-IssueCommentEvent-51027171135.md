<small>> @biagas can I ask you to take a quick look at the [a sample of the changed baseline `.txt` files](https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/pull/20442/commits/390c47b59183ce599c60cb2ffa8911e0c5433a8a) and ask if anything you see might suggest a problem for users? Oh, I should add a remark to release notes too. I'll do that now....</small>
