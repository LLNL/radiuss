<small>@marchdf yes that is what I meant. Well sort of. So the tarballs can be added instead of a git commit.  That way when spack is fetching a release it doesn't need to use git and can just directly download and unpack the tarball source.  I believe that is the prefered version for releases. @tldahlgren please correct me if I am wrong.  This is fine though....</small>
