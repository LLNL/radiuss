<small>@alalazo the performance numbers you reported are between 15 - 32% overhead vs. `develop` which is pretty disappointing for an encoding that's logically equivalent to what we had before.  I'll be interested to see what you come up with -- might also dig into the numbers myself.  Let's not merge until we decide whether this is acceptable or whether it can be mitigated....</small>
