<small>I squashed my commits but for some reason it still shows 5 other commits (that have all been merged into develop already). Does anyone know why this is or how to fix it? The commits for this branch are the ones under [fix stop-workers, refactor integration tests, and fix pylint errors](https://github.com/LLNL/merlin/pull/403/commits/68097ed39575c2ed2672c375f3d2f11dd0104cf3)...</small>
