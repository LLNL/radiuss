<small>As described at https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack/issues/127#issuecomment-2791184486 I was able to run these tests compiled with `ilp64` (outside of spack but at the same version `v2.2.0`) without any segmentation fault. The compiler and the dependencies mentioned there are exactly the same picked up by spack, just that there they are being pushed in by lmod and a dedicated compiler wrapper, whereas in spack I leave all of that to the spack infrastructure....</small>
