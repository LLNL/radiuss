<small>I am attaching a compressed tarball that contains the data set used to generate the images above. I tried opening visit 3.4 with the session files also included in the tarball and they didn't (seem to?) work for me (although I have not used session files before. I can reproduce the images above, though, by creating a pseudocolor on the scalar field in  the `sol_CAST_Conf1_TracBC_3_DispBC_2_fricCoeff0p20_*.mfem_root` files. Please let me know if reproduction is unclear....</small>
