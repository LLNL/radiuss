<small>Add shallow pretty printers and tests (#314)

New Pretty printers that would match the STL pretty printers pattern have been developed.
This version of the pretty printers do not show any implementation details and focus on the sole data.
Also, like the other pretty printers, those pretty printers do not deal with the permutations, so an error message was added.
Unit tests were written accordingly, but not activated yet, due to their very specific nature.</small>
