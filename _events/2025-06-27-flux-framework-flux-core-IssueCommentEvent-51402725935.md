<small>Also forgot to mention that this now has support for a module `priority` value. Module alternatives are sorted first by `priority` then by load order, so the last module configured gets preference if priorities are the same.  The default `priority` is `100`, and `sched-simple` has a configured priority of `50`....</small>
