<small>@haampie That order makes sense to me. The only reason it needs to be part of the spec with a variant is to mark for the install/future reuse. From and install point dev spec doesn't really matter? I guess it does in that you probably don't want to reuse a develop spec or rather don't want it masquerading as something it is not. Other than that I think it should be an environment property and not a spec property with the order you outlined. ...</small>
