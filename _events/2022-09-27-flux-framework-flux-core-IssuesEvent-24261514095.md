<p>how to distinguish between jobs that start an instance and those that don't in a shell plugin</p><small>We would our mpibind shell plugin to run when users launch a flux job that runs a user's code, but not when they just start a new instance. I.e. we'd like it to run by default when a user runs a 'flux mini run' or 'flux mini submit' command, but not when they run 'flux mini alloc' or 'flux mini batch'. Can this be detected in the initrc or in the plugin itself?...</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4625' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
