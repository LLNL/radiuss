<small>I am having similar issues with the xdmf files outputed from MCNP6.3. It will read in the file but only display the first mesh variables in visit. Removing the first two Collections on the meshes allows you to see all of the variables. Are there any plans to fix this and have a more robust way of handling MCNP6.3 generated xdmf files? Happy to provide example file if that would help....</small>
