<a href='https://github.com/biagas' target='_blank'>biagas</a> pushed to <a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit' target='_blank'>visit-dav/visit</a>

<small>Update View2DAttributes, View3DAttributes,DabaseCorrelation for python (#20368)

Added all custom code to their .code files with comments specifying the customizations for ease when comparisons after future regeneration.

Updated GeneratePython to allow for .code file specialized _Notify, _dir, _methods, as well as SLOT.

Regenerated the Py files for these.

There were a lot of changes due to the fact that they have been on the 'do not regenerate list' for quite awhile.</small>
