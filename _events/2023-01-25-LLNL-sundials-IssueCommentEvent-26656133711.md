<small>At present the SYCL NVector only supports targeting GPUs and has only been tested with Intel GPUs. Targeting GPUs from other vendors is possible using SYCL and oneMKL but is untested as the current focus is Intel GPU support. Any feedback on using the SYCL vector and oneMKL solver interface on other devices is welcome.  ...</small>
