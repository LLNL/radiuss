<small>Update: this PR is somewhat blocked by my ability to test it. I'll be moving to an older laptop soon, so the Qt installation should hopefully work. I'm hoping to get back to this then. Once I can build multiple versions of Qt, it will be much easier to test whether or not the hacks I've removed here are needed or not....</small>
