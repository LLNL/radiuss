<small>@victorapm This looks good to me. I left a few comments for your review. I'll let @rfalgout  chime in on the naming. We could use var (for variable instead of tag), but tag seems a bit more general, which I suppose this is, so that's fine with me. One small comment is the buildfunc<Iterleaved/contiguous> seems to me to be just setting the labels or tags. Can we add the 'tag' keyword like buildfunctags... to make that more clear? Thanks!...</small>
