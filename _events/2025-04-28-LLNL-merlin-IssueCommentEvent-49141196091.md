<small>I’ve wanted to reorganize Merlin’s code base so that it has less of these giant files for a while now. Based on these suggestions I think ChatGPT is correct that the way to go about this is to make Merlin’s code base more object oriented by splitting up giant classes into multiple classes and to refactor function-based modules into class-based modules (like router.py)....</small>
