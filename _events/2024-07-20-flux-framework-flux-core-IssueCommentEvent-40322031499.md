<small>Almost everything works, but there's an issue with mpi on the two most recent distros, fedora40 and noble.  It makes me wonder if there's another issue with the PMI in the newer mpich maybe? The problem goes away in the test that sets PSM3_HAL (not sure what that does, or why, but it fixes it ðŸ¤·). @garlick is there a chance this is related to the PMI issue you mentioned with hydra/mpich? I remember that was going the other way, but the cause of the bootstrap issue isn't jumping out at me....</small>
