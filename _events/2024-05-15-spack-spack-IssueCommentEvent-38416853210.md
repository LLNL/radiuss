<small>If you have access to a system with a Tesla or newer gpu where you can run singularity, this is the image we used: https://oaciss.nic.uoregon.edu/e4s/images/24.05/e4s-cuda80-x86_64-24.05.sif (Running it with the -e and --nv flags should work). It's over 45gb in size so I understand if that's not an option for you....</small>
