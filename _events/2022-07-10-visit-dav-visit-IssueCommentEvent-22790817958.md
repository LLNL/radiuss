<small>@smao-astro the `libffi-dev` issue is likely only the *first* problem that halted forward progress. I suspect there will be more before we can get a complete build. I think I am presently the only developer with access to an M1 mac and I have a number of other priorities as well. So, we can exchange thoughts here on progress but I think it will still be a while (likely several weeks), before I've been able to put in any time on this to complete it....</small>
