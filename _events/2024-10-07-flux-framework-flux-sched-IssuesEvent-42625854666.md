<p>fluxion specific `libintern.so` should have package-specific prefix and version suffix</p><small>Fluxion currently installs the string interner library as `/usr/lib64/libintern.so`. This has a larger than zero probability of conflicting with some other package, so as suggested by @jameshcorbett it should probably get a `fluxion` somewhere in there like `libfluxion-intern.so`....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1308' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
