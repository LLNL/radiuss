<small>> Just need to reemphasize that my suggestion to remove the boundary element generation in the first part of https://github.com/mfem/mfem/pull/4128#issuecomment-2037631281 would be one way of remove that limitation and make the fixes in this PR even more minimal. I don't think there was clear consensus that this was a necessary feature to add though maybe I am missing something....</small>
