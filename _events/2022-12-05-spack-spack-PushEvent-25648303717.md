<small>typing: move from comment annotations to Python 3.6 annotations

We've stopped supporting Python 2, and contributors are noticing that our CI no longer
allows Python 2.7 comment type hints. They end up having to adapt them, but this adds
extra unrelated work to PRs.

- [x] Move to 3.6 type hints across the entire code base</small>
