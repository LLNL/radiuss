<p>Inconsistent Dof numbering across ranks for RT elements on prismatic NC mesh</p><small>I have been attempting to use prismatic meshes with ex6p, and have generated some meshes that appear to trigger issues within the ParNCMesh structures. These meshes are generated with gmsh, and are of a cylindrical cavity. Using these meshes with ex1p they run just fine, and using a single rank on 6p they are also fine, so the issue appears to be isolated to ParNCMesh and ParFiniteElementSpace when calling the ParNCMesh. These meshes are available on the branch `cavity-prism-par-ncmesh-bug`. This has a sister issue https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3671 that I am also working on....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3672' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
