<small>I have not had a chance to work on this (I'm still stuck on updating BLT/RAJA/Umpire/CHAI and a host of other libraries with outdated build systems that needed to be changed to build with C++14). But what would be helpful is updating the documentation for how to use addNode manually (that way we could pass a pointer to a class that has a private constructor, e.g. a singleton, to be registered)....</small>
