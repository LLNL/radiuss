<small>Great work, thanks @ilumsden! In addition to the documentation it would be great to add an example like the c/cxx/fortran-example apps in the examples/apps directory for the Python annotations. A unit test would also be great. The Caliper unit tests are actually run through Python already so it shouldn't be too difficult to add; check out the tests/ci_app_tests directory. I'm happy to help if needed....</small>
