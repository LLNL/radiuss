<small>I do not believe any part of Fluxion depends on the Python `boost` package, though I'm not as familiar with this project as I am with flux-core. I looked at this particular test and didn't find any evidence of an extra python dependency. However, it would help to have the log from the failing test if we can access it....</small>
