<small>I can confirm the latest patch fixes the problem ðŸŽ‰ . However, let me bring up again that conceptually the main problem is not that some case is not supported by `QuadratureInterpolator`, which is understandable, but that there is no fallback in `QuadratureFunction::ProjectGridFunction()`, so even things that worked in version 1.* do not work anymore and sometimes are not even detected....</small>
