<small>Hi @vsoch , Thank you for the info about OpenMPI and sorry about delayed response. The tests you ran in the link above are very impressive. I would like to recreate them on the cloud clusters I have access to (which are not k8s, but VMs). Please feel free to reuse the Parsl-Flux example I've been testing. This is a [link to the Parsl workflow](https://github.com/parallelworks/parsl_mpi/blob/main/run_on_cluster/FluxExec_SlurmProv.py) and a[ link the script](https://github.com/parallelworks/parsl_mpi/blob/main/run_on_cluster/install_scripts/step_01a_install_with_Spack.sh) I used to install Flux on the cluster....</small>
