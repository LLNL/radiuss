<p>Questions about ComputeFluxEnergy for CurlCurlIntegrator, and `L2ZZErrorEstimator`</p><small>I am currently looking into using the `L2ZZErrorEstimator` for the `CurlCurlIntegrator`, in particular for the case where there is a matrix coefficient in L2^{dxd}, I.e. it is discontinuous between elements (think a slab of material next to some air). The resulting numerical flux must also be in L2^d, whilst from electromagnetic theory, in the absence of a surface current density the true flux should have a continuous tangential component and thus be in ND. As a result, this makes it ideal for recovery as a ZZ estimator, and I am hoping to use it to drive some AMR....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3536' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
