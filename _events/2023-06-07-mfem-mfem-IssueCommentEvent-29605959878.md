<small>Thanks for the pointer Veselin. Forgive me my ignorance, but now I am not sure what I am misunderstanding here now. I guess my assumption that (analogical to hypercubes) the "canonical" Gauss-Legendre points on tetrahedra can be reconstructed from the internally used product construction via 1D (Gauss-Legendre) points is wrong? If so, may I also ask if there is there some disadvantage in constructing product bases which coincide with the Gauss-Legendre point, if this is even possible? ...</small>
