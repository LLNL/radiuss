<small>It's been a little while since I took graphics in school, and I don't know a whole lot about our transform operator, but I thought that the order needed to always be scale, rotate, translate. You should be able to get every configuration with that order. I am surprised to hear that we do rotations first; is there a reason for that? I thought scaling needed to come first because scaling is typically done in the x, y, and z directions, and doing a rotation first will change what you are scaling....</small>
