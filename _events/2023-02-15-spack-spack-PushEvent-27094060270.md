<small>Orca: Added required runtime libraries (#35481)

* Update package.py
  Several libraries are need to be present at run time so that the code can be run in parallel. 
  I have added them as dependencies and to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Orca comes as a binary so the libraries cannot be added as RPATH at compilation time.
  Also, orca 5.0.3 was compiled against 4.1.1, not 4.1.2.</small>
