<small>Sure, some easier ways how to define palettes would be nice and may include that alphas ðŸ˜‰ . But I was thinking of something basic at the level of the default palettes, where you also cannot specify any levels you want highlight, but still most of the people are fine with that. Most of the palettes are linear, highlighting one end of the scale, so that would match the 0 to 1 gradient, or they have uniformly distributed levels, which can be achieved by repetition of the alpha gradient....</small>
