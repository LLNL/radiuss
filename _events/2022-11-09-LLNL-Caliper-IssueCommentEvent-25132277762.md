<small>I see the latest release notes talk about a `roctracer` service so it looks like something was implemented, but I don't quickly find any documentation for it on the documentation site. Perhaps my issue is really just asking for documentation on how to use the new `cuda.gputime` and `rocm.gputime` config options?...</small>
