<small>To be honest, I don't think it occurred to me until much later.  I always treated `USER` directives as being "inward" or "away from root" but since they can arbitrarily switch like `su` it does clean things up some.  If this ends up working, and especially if we run into this on other containers, it might be the way to go in future....</small>
