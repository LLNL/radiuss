<small>@oseikuffuor1 Initially that is what I have done, used HYPRE_ILU, rather than EUCLID, but I have found its behaviour to not be very robust with varying number of mpi processes. Replacing zero pivots with small entries sound like a good idea, what range of "small numbers" (relative to drop tol or min/max of matrix at hand) would you recommend to use to replace zero pivots?...</small>
