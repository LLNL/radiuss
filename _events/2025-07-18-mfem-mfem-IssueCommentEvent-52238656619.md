<small>Thanks, that information helps. libCEED can do GMG in other contexts, as you see in the MFEM Poisson example and also we do it in our own solid mechanics code, Ratel, so I suspect that you're right and there's something awry in the grid restriction operation. I have funded work that has priority but I can try to dig around a bit as I find time in coming weeks....</small>
