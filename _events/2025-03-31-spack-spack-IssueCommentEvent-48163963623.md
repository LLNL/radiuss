<small>> I am not sure how to determine what constitutes a sucessfull OpenFOAM build. [wmake](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/blob/master/wmake/wmake?ref_type=heads#L814) does not use the return code of `make` to determine if the installation was successful and there are probably situations they don't want the installation to abort prematurely....</small>
