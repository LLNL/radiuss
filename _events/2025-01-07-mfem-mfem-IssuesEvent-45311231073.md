<p>Can we solve a problem consisting of sub-regions with different sets of unknowns?</p><small>In a model of solid mechanics, the primary unknown is the displacement, say, u. If we use some high-order model, the gradient of the displacement is defined as another unknown.And if a region needs to adopt the mixed formulation, the pressure has to be defined as a unknown. These regions share the same primary unknown, i.e., u, and their interfaces share nodes. If we do not enforce additional coupling constraints (for example, through the Lagrangian multiplier method), can we solve such a problem by MFEM?...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4656' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
