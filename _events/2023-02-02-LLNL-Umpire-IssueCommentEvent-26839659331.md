<small>Thanks for the suggestion @davidbeckingsale. I tried adding the `--gcc-toolchain` flag to our spack.yaml (attached), but it seems as though the flag was not picked up. Maybe my syntax is off.. The spack build output is also attached - it's picking up gcc10.2.0 and hipcc as the compilers, but still finding the 4.8.5 include dir....</small>
