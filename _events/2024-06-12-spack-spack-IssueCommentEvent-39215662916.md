<small>Thanks @teaguesterling ! Yes to reproduce you'll want to use focal, that's what we do here. https://github.com/flux-framework/spack/actions/runs/9475771589/workflow I'm running again without that one cache and I can report back. We can also update to jammy, which probably makes sense to do soon anyway. Let me know what you find (and if it's related to focal)....</small>
