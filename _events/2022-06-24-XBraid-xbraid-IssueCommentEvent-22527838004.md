<small>@lankes-fzj, glad this worked for you! In order to understand what XBraid is doing and how/when it calls various functions, you really need to understand the MGRIT algorithm (which XBraid implements). The [publications page](https://github.com/XBraid/xbraid/wiki/Project-Publications) has lots of papers you can look at, but I would recommend starting with [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/XBraid/xbraid/papers/mgritPaper-2013-3.pdf). If you're not already familiar with some parallel in time algorithms or multigrid, it may take a while to really understand what the algorithm is doing... but hopefully this can clarify things for you!...</small>
