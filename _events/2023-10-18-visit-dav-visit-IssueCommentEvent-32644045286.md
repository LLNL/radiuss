<small>Everything I've read about reproducibility and keeping things from breaking says to *pin* versions. But, I myself really have no idea. I took `requirements.in` as the simplest statement about what we need to gen the docs. But, RTD wants a `requirements.txt` file, not a `reqirements.in` file. So, I used `pip-compile` (on LC's CZ systems) to produce `requirements.txt` which worked both manually, locally and on RTD. So, I took it verbatim and moved on....</small>
