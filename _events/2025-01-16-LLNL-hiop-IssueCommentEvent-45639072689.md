<small>> [@cameronrutherford](https://github.com/cameronrutherford) You fixed this issue in PR [#695](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop/pull/695) , didn't you? BTW, would you mind pointing us where we can find the documentation for using GHCR for ExaGO, e.g., steps to create the docker image and linked it with CI pipeline. Cheers!...</small>
