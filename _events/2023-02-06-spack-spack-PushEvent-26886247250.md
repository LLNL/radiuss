<small>qt: new versions 6.4.0, 6.4.1, 6.4.2 (#34698)

* qt: new versions 6.4.0, 6.4.1

- New libpsl vendored dependency in qt-base.
- New embree and tinyexr dependency in qt-quick3d.

We need to figure out a better way to deal with these vendored
dependencies in src/3rdparty. Removing them was a way to make sure
they are not used unintentionally. Many of these dependencies cannot
be overridden with a QT_FEATURE_system_* flag and are included directly
in cpp files. Many change versions from release to release, so even if
they use system (ie spack managed) versions we need to support this in
the depends_on lines.

What we can rely on?
- src/3rdparty is where vendored stuff is stored
- not much else...

Possible ways to deal with this:
- Change vendor_deps_to_keep to dict with versions, eg
```
vendor_deps_to_keep = {
    "xatlas": "@6:",
    "embree": "@6.4:",
    "tinyexr": "@6.4:",
}
```
- Similarly introduce system_deps_to_use:
```
system_deps_to_use = {
    "assimp@5.2:": "@6:",
}
```
and derive depends_on and QT_FEATURE_system_* from this dict.

* qt-*: new version 6.4.2, invert vendored pkgs logic

* qt-base: fix vendor_deps_to_avoid typo

* qt-*: move lots into QtPackage base layer</small>
