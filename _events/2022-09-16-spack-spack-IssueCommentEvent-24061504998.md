<small>> @balos1 the following works for me spack install superlu-dist@8.1.0~int64+cuda cuda_arch=60 I'm not sure why this doesn't work for you. I think somehow you are mixing gcc 4.8.5 and gcc 9.3.0, the error indicates gcc version is too low. See https://groups.google.com/g/turbulenz-engine-users/c/Mk7MrwvIkZ0?pli=1...</small>
