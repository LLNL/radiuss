<small>There is apparently no way to get `mypy` to understand anything but the checks documented in [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#version-and-platform-checking), which they intentionally say are "simple".  The `mypy` developers don't seem particularly enthused about covering more cases, and someone would have to decide which ones to support, etc. See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/8547#issuecomment-601813024....</small>
