<small>I would think `GetQueryOutputValue` for the XRay Image query could return either a list of the names of the files it produced or, a list of the Silo variables and/or meshes it produced (in the one and only Silo file...if that is how the most recent implementation behaves). If it fails, it produces `Py_None` in `GetQueryOutputValue`. So, just a swizzle on @brugger1 idea but is more specifically indicating what the *outputs* actually where....</small>
