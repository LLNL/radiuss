<small>The time for `event.begin#region` events is the time since the previous event (or, for the first region, the time since Caliper was initialized). Note that these are exclusive times, if you need inclusive times (i.e. the total time in a each region including its children) add `CALI_TIMER_INCLUSIVE_DURATION=true`. For the MPI rank add `mpi` to the `CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE` list....</small>
