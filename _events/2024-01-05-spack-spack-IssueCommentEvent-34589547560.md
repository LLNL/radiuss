<small>Thanks for starting this discussion. One thing that comes to mind is that if `Cargo.lock` is held constant, we should be able to reproduce builds from months or years prior. This is somewhat in conflict with having a common install of spack that may be upgraded (and `spack external find`, but that is a loophole with any external dependencies and people who are pedantic about this are likely building from carefully managed containers)....</small>
