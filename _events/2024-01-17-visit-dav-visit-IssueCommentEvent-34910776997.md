<small>No. This is mainly fixing python issues for newer python (3.9) in VTK 8 and Qt 5.14 and a Qt 5.14 funky patch on arm64. The other PR (#18642) fixes a number of the *current* TPLs for arm64 (instead of, for example, going to newer versions of those TPLs which may already work on arm64)....</small>
