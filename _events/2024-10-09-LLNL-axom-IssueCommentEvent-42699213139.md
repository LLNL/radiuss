<small>The one Axom dependency that exists in these collection classes is slic, as there are a few assertions and one warning.  Removing them would have no effect on the functionality, but would increase risk in the case that calls are made that would have triggered the assertions or warning.  Is there a reasonable alternative to slic in this case?...</small>
