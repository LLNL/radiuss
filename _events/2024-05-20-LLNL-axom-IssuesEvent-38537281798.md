<p>Fast closest_point operator for Quadrilateral and/or Polygon</p><small>Does anyone know of a fast algorithm for computing the closest point to a (possibly non-planar and possibly concave) quadrilateral or polygon? I have an application that currently computes the algebraic center of a quadrilateral and then uses that to divide the quadrilateral into 4 triangles. The closest point is then computed for each triangle and we take the one with the minimum squared distance. But this algorithm is expensive (currently accounts for about 15% of the run time)....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/axom/issues/1342' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
