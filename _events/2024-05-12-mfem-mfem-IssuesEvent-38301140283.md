<p>Electromagnetic skin effect in different wire shapes, in 2D.</p><small>I looked at the examples but I do not find any that compute the current density distribution in a wire according to frequency. When AC current circulate in a wire, the current has a tendency to concentrate on the perimeter of the wire, this is the skin effect. My goal is to use a 2D section of the wire and compute the current density distribution for various frequencies and then of various section shapes....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4300' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
