<small>Ok great. I just ran into this again today as I was building ospray on the closed side. Was wondering if I should just make a script that puts everything where it needs to go to avoid the headaches for next time when we do the actual 3.4.2 release. Sounds like you will make life better by then so no need to make a script now....</small>
