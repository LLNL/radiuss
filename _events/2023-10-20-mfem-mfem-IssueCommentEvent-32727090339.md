<small>> Just capturing some in-person discussion that happened today with @jandrej: I think this is good to go... although it would be even better if the SUNDIALS ex16 could be updated so `ARKStepSolver::UseMFEMMassLinearSolver` is included in the "tests" to prevent such a bug down the road. That all sad, I will have no heartburn if this is merged as-is given it is a bugfix....</small>
