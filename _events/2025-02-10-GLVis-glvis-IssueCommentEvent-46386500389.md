<small>I agree that I don't think we'd want to support this by socket, but it would be a very sensible feature for saved data. I believe the `*.sol` file type does not have the option to store time-dependent fields (please correct me if I'm wrong). We could use a filename convention (eg `velocity_1.sol`, `velocity_2.sol`, etc) but that convention is already used for parallel output....</small>
