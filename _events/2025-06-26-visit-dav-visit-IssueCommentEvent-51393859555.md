<small>I  set vtkLogger verbosity level to OFF when VisIt is first started (added the logic to InitVTK.C).  The streamlines with ribbons no longer spit out messages to the terminal.  I then tried changing the verbosity to something else when Anari was enabled, but still  no messages to the terminal.  So it seems the logging is either on or off....</small>
