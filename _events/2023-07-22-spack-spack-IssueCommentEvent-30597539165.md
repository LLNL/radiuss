<small>@AlexanderRichert-NOAA @alalazo  et.al., anecdotally `ufs-utils` for tagged versions will [fail to unpack with `spack` as this issue originally notes](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/37255#issuecomment-1526302002) with `git v2.27.1` (loaded as a system module) but succeeds with `git v2.32.0` (loaded as a system module); perhaps that helps with [this comment](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/37255#issuecomment-1528092136)....</small>
