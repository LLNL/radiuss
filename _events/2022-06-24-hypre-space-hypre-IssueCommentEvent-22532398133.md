<small>> Hi @waynemitchell and @liruipeng . I do think we should be more specific with the name of `hypre_Item` since it is very device/GPU specific and defined in `utilities/device_utils.h`. Maybe `hypre_DeviceItem` or `hypre_GPUItem` or `hypre_WarpItem` or ...? I don't understand the meaning of this object well enough to suggest a good name, but hopefully you get the idea....</small>
