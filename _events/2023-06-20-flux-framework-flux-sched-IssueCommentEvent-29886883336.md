<small>@garlick and @vsoch  - Thank you very much for the help. I was able to get the Parsl -> Flux workflow to run the MPI hello-world app compiled with `intel-oneapi-mpi` (installed in Spack). This is probably fine for my purposes for the immediate future. Would it be helpful for you and the Flux team if I open an issue about MPI hello-world compiled with OpenMPI not working in Parsl->Flux workflows? It seems that you're already aware of issues with OpenMPI and I don't want a new issue (that is not blocking me) to distract from your efforts.  Alternatively, if testing OpenMPI with Flux in a Parsl workflow would make for a useful development environment/use case scenario for you, then it seems opening an issue would be a benefit. Please let me know if you do want that issue opened; otherwise I'll assume it can wait for a while....</small>
