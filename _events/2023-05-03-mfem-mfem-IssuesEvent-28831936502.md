<p>inconsistent norms in linear and nonlinear solvers leads to nonconvergence</p><small>`mfem::GMRESSolver` and `mfem::CGSolver` measure the residual norm after applying the preconditioner, while `mfem::NewtonSolver` (which has no notion of a preconditioner) measure the residual norm directly. This can lead to infinite loops where a newton iterate whose residual is just above the absolute tolerance needs another linear solve, but the krylov method exits immediately because it concludes that residual norm after preconditioning is below the absolute tolerance....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3641' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
