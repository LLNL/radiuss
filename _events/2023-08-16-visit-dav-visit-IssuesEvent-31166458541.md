<p>Changing the default values for coordinates</p><small>I am trying to perform core-collapse supernovae evolution from core bounce until shock breakout, which spans a distance of ~ 1e13 cm, in spherical geometry. For that purpose, I am using modified uniform mesh grid in Flash-X. The mesh grid has been modified to get a log spacing in radial direction between blocks (these are just a certain number of cells) while having uniform spacing within the block (among the cells in the block). For example, a 1D spherical grid with 2 blocks and 16 cells per block, would have constant delta for the first 16 cells within the first block, however for the cells in the next block, delta will be different than the first block. ...</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/18889' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
