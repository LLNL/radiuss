<small>The CMake `find_package` issue has to do with the deprecation of `FindCUDA` in CMake as of version 3.27 (see #232).  Any chance you can use an earlier version of CMake?  I have partially updated the `staging` branch to use `FindCUDAToolkit`, which hopefully will address this.  I will push these changes in the next few days but would like to do more testing first....</small>
