<small>One other thing to stew on that i was playing with during testing this: maybe having an even more verbose log level would be handy to capture things like the raw sacct/squeue/etc outputs so that the logs are closer to fully reproducing errors.   'trace' level?   and maybe part of that is even looking through everything and pushing some debug info up into info for things users might be interested in?...</small>
