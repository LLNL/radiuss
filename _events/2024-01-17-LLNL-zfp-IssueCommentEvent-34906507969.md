<small>@lindstro I've been trying to find *why* we force H5Z-ZFP to only work with ZFP with 8bit stream and I can't see it documented anywhere. I mean, we do document *that* we need it but not *why*. I assume it is somehow related to portability. That said, it large campaign workflows, its rare that a file is moved *outside* of where it is generated meaning that portability issues are not necessarily a significant concern for many use cases. ...</small>
