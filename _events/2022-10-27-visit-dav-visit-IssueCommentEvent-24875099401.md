<small>@markcmiller86: Yes, the comments are the time for each plot state . . .  Having that data there allows us to easily parse that file, and overwrite states that are going to be recalculated on restarting the code (of course, we could read the Silo files, but that would be a fair bit of new code for us, and this was easier).  Without that, we can get a fair bit of duplication on restart....</small>
