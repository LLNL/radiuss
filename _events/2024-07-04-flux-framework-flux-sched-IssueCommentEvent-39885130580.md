<small>I think the flux-core spec file has some code, possibly commented out, that will dump the output files from failed tests. Or you can temporarily cat *. output in the specfile. If you have tests that only fail in the buildfarm but succeed on TOSS 4 actual systems, then you could consider disabling tests for this release. ...</small>
