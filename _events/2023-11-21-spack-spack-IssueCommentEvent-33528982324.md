<small>I don't see why #36179 is necessary really. It does more than necessary to solve certain issues, and it's not the only solution to the issues it claims to solve. For example for multi-valued variants the complaint is that spack merges the provided list with the package defaults -- that's pretty weird, how about not doing that?...</small>
