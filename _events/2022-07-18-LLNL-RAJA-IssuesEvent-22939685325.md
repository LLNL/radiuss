<p>Resource Stream Testing</p><small>For stream execution support of RAJA::forall and RAJA::kernel #966  we don't currently have a way to test if RAJA loops are being executed asynchronously on separate streams. It would be nice to be able to test this. I've been thinking about writing a test which performs timing comparisons against a set of asynchronous and synchronous calls, however I don't think that is a very reliable test. Another way to simply test is to check the corresponding stream IDs, however I'm not aware of a way to pull the current stream ID from within device code....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/issues/969' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
