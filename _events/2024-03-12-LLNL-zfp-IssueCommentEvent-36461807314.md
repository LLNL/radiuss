<small>No worries.  Admittedly this example is not all that self explanatory when it comes to the output it produces.  Its main purpose is not to evaluate rounding errors (as other errors also contribute) or performance, but rather to show how to use the zfp array API in various ways to solve this simple numerical problem, e.g., using fixed- and variable-rate arrays, using indexing vs. iterators, using single- and multi-threading, etc....</small>
