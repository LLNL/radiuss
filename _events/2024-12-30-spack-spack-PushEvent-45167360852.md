<small>mpich: gather in a single place env modifications needed by mpich derivatives (#48276)

* mpich: gather in a single place env modifications needed by mpich derivatives

MPICH, and its derivatives, share a lot of copy/paste code to setup the
environment during the different stages of the package life-cycle.

This commit gathers the common modifications in a single place (a mixin class),
living in the Mpich package, and makes derivatives import, and reuse, it.

* Fix docs for Python < 3.13</small>
