<small>First, press the `e` key to hide the boundary elements; then press `u`/`U` to move the level set value; to add/remove more level sets use `v`/`V`. This is documented here: https://github.com/GLVis/glvis/blob/master/README.md#key-commands and in the more advanced keys for 3D scalar data, here: https://github.com/GLVis/glvis/blob/master/README.md#3d-scalar-data. You can also use the cutting plane to see inside the level sets (without that you'll probably see just the outermost level set) -- use the `i` key for that (see the above docs). By default, the cutting plane is colored using solution values, however you can hide it with the `E` key (see the docs). The cutting plane can be rotated and moved using `x`/`X`, `y`/`Y`, and `z`/`Z` (see the docs)....</small>
