<small>Hi @JianboLong, I think in order to provide any further help here I would need you to provide a minimal working (or not working) example of what you are trying to achieve. Without knowing the available constructors to your vector type, I can't really help. I don't see why looping over the elements of the `mfem::Array` and copying to your type is not a valid solution....</small>
