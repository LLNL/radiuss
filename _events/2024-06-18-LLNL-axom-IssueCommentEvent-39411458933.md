<small>We are building Spheral_CXX target as shared, we are a C++ code with a python only interface essentially, so our C++ / CUDA library needs to be built shared so all of our python modules can point to the same instance at runtime. We've been building and linking our libraries with NVCC in this way for quite a long time in preparation for the GPU port. This issue only showed up after updating to axom 0.9.0....</small>
