<small>> Ok, here we go. Just @v-dobrev , based on the discussion on Slack, the preference was to use tags instead of branches for github-actions to prevent the situation when `master` was falling behind these branches. @justinlaughlin wanted to add it to CONTRIBUTING.md, but it ended up in the closed [mfem/github-actions#13](https://github.com/mfem/github-actions/pull/13) . In any case, for this PR, it does not change anything as the syntax does not distinguish between branches and tags....</small>
