<small>From the log file, it seems we have vanishing gradients, based on the fact that the loss is barely changing. I should mention including `lbann.Scale(x, constant=1)` that in my StyleGAN implementation causes the loss to grow without bound (exploding gradients). That is what motivated the idea at the end of my original post on the issue in back-prop....</small>
