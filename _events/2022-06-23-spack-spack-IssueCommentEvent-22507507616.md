<small>I am hesitant to add more of these version checks in `install`. The ones that are currently there are insufficient and will be removed by #30627 as soon as I get time to finish it up. Is the current behavior (i.e., with this PR) a hard break for your workflow? Would you be able to do `boost@1.72.0~nowide~json`?...</small>
