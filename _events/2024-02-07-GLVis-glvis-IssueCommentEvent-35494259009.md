<small>If there is too many options we might need a different interface to choose a colormap besides "cycling". Maybe the most common colormaps can be cycled through, and for those who want more options, a separate hotkey could let you input a name to a specific colormap. That way we could add in as many colormaps as we want without cluttering the colormap cycle....</small>
