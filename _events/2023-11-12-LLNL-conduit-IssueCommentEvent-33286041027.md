<small>@JustinPrivitera it looks like something went wrong in the merge of this PR? the merge commit [c72fb73](https://github.com/LLNL/conduit/commit/c72fb7336a02e2dd45211a44cb4eed465584b535) doesn't seem to actually include most of the changes of the PR, and the functionality isn't present in the current `develop` branch...</small>
