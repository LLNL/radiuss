<small>I figured that this is to ensure a range [0,ndoms-1] of indices that will make nicely numbered filenames. Assuming the state/domain_id already contains a good range of indices then does it matter which rank writes? It looks like the ranks each write independent HDF5 files. I would think the root file would not know the difference....</small>
