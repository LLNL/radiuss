<small>Not yet. I've managed to side step it so far by looking in the crash message for the mfem method that fails, then manually calling that from within mfem. Ultimately this strategy is going to run out of road though so I'll have to figure this out. I have to use the brew clang mostly because of using llvm for other libraries, so I'm not sure I can get away with just using apple clang instead. Based on Veselin's comment, I suspect it might be that somehow it's finding something built with apple clang when it should have brew or vice versa. ...</small>
