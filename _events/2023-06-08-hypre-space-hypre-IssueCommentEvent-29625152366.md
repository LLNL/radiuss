<small>Hi @hypre-space/developers .  It looks like we only configure `--with-print-errors` in our tux regression tests.  We probably should add this flag to one of the compiles in a few of our other test scripts.  What do you think and what specifically would you suggest?  BTW, I don't think we necessarily need to add the `TEST_error` run-test to any of the other scripts besides tux, but adding the configuration flag seems like a good idea....</small>
