<small>I am on crusher testing right now and this is an issue that keeps rearing it's head. I think unless spack is specifically going to utilize the multi-arch library in the same install tree feature I don't think it is worth leaving this additional bit of complexity here. It is turning into bugs that are just hiding until some unfortunate soul tries to install the wrong combination of environment features....</small>
