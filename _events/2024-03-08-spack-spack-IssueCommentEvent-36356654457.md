<small>Having a spack package for rosetta would be super helpful. I'm struggling with a build of it right now. I have a few changes to the file you proposed here. Mainly changing the 'extras' to be an array instead of a string as the spaces in the string seem to break things but no matter how I build, I get a libzlib.so not found error. Should it be built extras=static? I took it out and added a dep for libz and got the same error. Did you get a package.py for Rosetta to work?...</small>
