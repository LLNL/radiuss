<small>I successfully tested this on Frontier with ginkgo@glu_experimental built with rocm/5.2. I haven't been able to build ginkgo@glu_experimental with more recent versions of ROCm. @fritzgoebel correct me if I'm wrong, but the interface will need to be changed again to use ginkgo@1.7.0 (assuming that version has everything we need for HiOp)....</small>
