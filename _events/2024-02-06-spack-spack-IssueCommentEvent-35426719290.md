<small>@adamjstewart hi Adam, thank you for bearing with me, much appreciated. I've brought back dependencies for deprecated versions (and adjusted them as well). Also, I didn't close/resolve your comments above, so you can go through them and close by yourself if you think they are completed, otherwise I can do that if there are no objections....</small>
