<small>It's possible there's an openblas problem: I've seen both build errors *and* accidental requirement of newer CPU instructions (manifesting as SIGILL when calling certain BLAS functions). Given the error message which looks like a missing symbol, and the fact that the toolchain works on an older architecture, I'm not sure what's going on. It would be helpful to run unit tests for openblas on the failing machine....</small>
