<small>For a shallow copy of conduit to sidre, the resulting sidre hierarchy would have to have all external views for its leaves, as the data would already be allocated and owned elsewhere, either by conduit or by someone else using conduit's external data support.  This is not to discourage an implementation, as this should be useful functionality to provide more complete interoperability between the libraries, though anyone using it will need to exercise the extra care needed to avoid errors with the pointers to external data....</small>
