<small>After a group meeting, it was determined that the `content.sqlite` that was specifically recovered was from a live system and likely created via a block by block copy of itself, i.e. `cp content.sqlite content.sqlite.bak` or whatever.  This would not ensure the `content.sqlite` was in a good state....</small>
