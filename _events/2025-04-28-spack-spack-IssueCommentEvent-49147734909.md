<small>Looking at following file from the last commit in this branch: https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/packages/llvm-build-with-intel-compilers-fix/lib/spack/spack/aliases.py, it looks like `intel-oneapi-compilers` is the builtin package name for the legacy compiler `oneapi`. So, with the current state of the `develop` branch, I suspect `intel-oneapi-compilers` will be preferred....</small>
