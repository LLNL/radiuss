<small>Ok @vsoch , think the version parsing/logging should be sorted out now: the broker version parser gets tested against [several semver patterns including the flux dev build strings you reported here](https://github.com/LLNL/maestrowf/pull/415/files#diff-2d84773568e6c28ed657f2cbedd6e9d1b05f8417535f5d2794f66897dd937f5bR15).  let me know if there's some other variants flux brokers might report and need testing here....</small>
