<small>Thankyou for this incredibly helpful and elaborate response! I think I understand how it works now, so as far as I am concerned this issue can be closed. Is there a place where this sort of implementation details of MFEM are described in more detail? (aside from the code/doxygen itself ofcourse)....</small>
