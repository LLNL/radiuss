<small>I like these modifications to the simplify the `--setattr` option and make it more usable. @grondo also suggested having it default to 1 if no option is given, which would simplify things even further. So, `--setattr=system.clear-ssd=1` could be simplified to `--setattr=clear-ssd`....</small>
