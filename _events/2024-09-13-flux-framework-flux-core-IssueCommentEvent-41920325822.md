<small>Yeah, OpenMPI should work, but if we want the library to be loaded we would have to bind mount it into the container and do a great deal of extra intrusive work to do that. Even domain sockets would need to be bind mounted in, but at least wouldnâ€™t require injecting a library that may or may not be compiled with a compatible libc....</small>
