<small>Package/py pysam macos (#33851)

* cleaned up style, linked to external htslib

* removed htslib/bcfrools/samtools deps, use bundled libs instead

the pysam package includes the necessary libs to link to, so it wasn't even using linked libs when building

* fixed style

* revert to using external htslib

currently uses bundled samtools and bcftools, and there is no way to use external versions for those dependencies

* added libs property to htslibs package

added support for lib64

* added htslib name</small>
