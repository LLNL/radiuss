<small>@agcapps maybe paranoia on my part. Many use cases work fine with std::vector<bool>. However, for technical reasons and choices made by the C++ standards committee, it doesn't follow the same rules as other STL containers.  As long as it works for what you are using it for and it remains limited in scope (i.e., not requiring massive changes if something goes wrong in the future), I say we go with what you have.   https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/328112/how-did-stdvectorbool-come-about...</small>
