<small>use default modify scope if no scope contains key (#48777)

If you use `spack config change` to modify a `require:` section that did
not exist before, Spack was inserting the merged configuration into the
highest modification scope (which for example would clutter the
environment's `spack.yaml` with a bunch of configuration details 
from the defaults).</small>
