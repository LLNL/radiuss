<small>Very interesting post-commit (https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/34236/commits/eeeb696ef2f3c93ad54506a23422ab335b2c0aa9) results that at least initially seem to involve sections of code that, at first blush, were not touched by this PR.  I also saw some issues reported earlier that I though I'd resolved a couple of days ago....</small>
