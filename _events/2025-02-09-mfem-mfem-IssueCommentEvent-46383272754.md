<small>For this problem the solution goes to zero when $\xi=\pi$. If I enforce the Dirichlet boundary condition at the upper boundary and not at the lower boundary then I find only the trivial solution ($\theta(\xi) = 0$). However, if I enforce the Dirichlet boundary conditions at both ends then I do converge to the correct solution. While this is a perfectly fine solution to this particular problem, I am still concerned about not the difficulty I am having enforcing both boundary conditions at the same point. ...</small>
