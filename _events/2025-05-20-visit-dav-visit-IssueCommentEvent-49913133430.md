<small>Noting here that now that this opaque weighting in the query is indeed very risky for end-users and it would be much appreciated if the query names would match common definitions, and especially any deviations should be clearly stated in the query window. In general, having a short description visible in the query window would be a really good addition. The more exotic ones could also have references (c.f. MeshLab who include citations to particular filters!)....</small>
