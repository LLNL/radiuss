<small>Can you explain what breaks with hypre_CTAlloc?  That should ultimately call calloc so I don't understand the issue.  We should be able to use our own wrapper routines for memory allocation.  Either we need to fix something in our wrappers or maybe this is something that needs to be taken up with the Umpire folks.  Let me know.  Thanks!...</small>
