<a href='https://github.com/alalazo' target='_blank'>alalazo</a> pushed to <a href='https://github.com/spack/spack' target='_blank'>spack/spack</a>

<small>(To be revisited) builtin: add cc, cxx, and fortran properties

These properties are implemented in the same way in each compiler
package, at least for external specs. So, push the implementation
to the base class for now.

This needs to be revisited, to make the base class less dependent
on C, C++, and Fortran.</small>
