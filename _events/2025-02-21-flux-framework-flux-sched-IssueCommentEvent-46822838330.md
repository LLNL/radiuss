<small>Pushed some new tests for the new constraint checks to address the Codecov report (and simplified the checks slightly). Also noticed that negative values (particularly for max) could pass validation because of integer overflow after being read into the unsigned variables, so I tweaked the checks on min/max values to hopefully catch that as well....</small>
