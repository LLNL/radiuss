<small>git: new version 2.40.0 (#36354)

Release notes: https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.40.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.40.0.txt (nothing worrisome there).

Commit history with recent changes to installation procedure: https://github.com/git/git/commits/master/INSTALL (nothing worrisome there).

This builds fine on my system,
```
==> git: Successfully installed git-2.40.0-sb7gmy64ivwstfwwjyff7y5mbbc7vtos
