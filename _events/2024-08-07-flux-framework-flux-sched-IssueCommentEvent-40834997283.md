<small>Not sure what's up with codecov, the measure on their website is that this somehow increased coverage by 0.06%, and then on here it says it failed and decreased coverage by 0.2%... Everything else is passing, and this doesn't actually change any tests, or implementation so... Yeah, perplexed about that....</small>
