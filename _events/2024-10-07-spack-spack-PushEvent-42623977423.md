<small>darshan-runtime: add new variants (#46847)

* add new darshan-runtime variants
   - `lustre` variant enables instrumentation of Lustre files
       * requires Lustre headers, so Lustre is a proper dependency
         for this variant
   - `log_path` variant allows setting of a centralized log directory
     for Darshan logs (commonly used for facility deployments)
       * when this variant is used, the `DARSHAN_LOG_DIR_PATH` env var
         is no longer used to set the log file path
   - `group_readable_logs` variant sets Darshan log permissions to
     allow reads from users in the same group
* add mmap_logs variant to enable usage of mmap logs</small>
