<small>@akohlmey FYI. Note that I needed to add installation steps in the `examples/plugins/CMakeLists.txt`. I made the choice to install to `<prefix>/lib{64}/lammps/plugins`. Any plugin that follows that convention will be automatically detected by lammps when installed into a Spack environment....</small>
