<small>> > I like this idea: it makes permutations and layouts much easier to use. However, I think it should be called something like `ViewMaker`, or something else. When I see `Reshape`, I think that this will take an existing View I've already defined, and will alter its dimensions. Instead, this PR is creating a wrapper that returns a new View, and can be used to construct Views from scratch. I realize that `ReShape` is used in a similar way in MFEM as well, so if everyone else is on board with this then that's fine with me too....</small>
