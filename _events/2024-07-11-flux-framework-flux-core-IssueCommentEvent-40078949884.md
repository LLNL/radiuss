<small>I think the goal (at least for accounting) here is to be able to enforce a resource limit across all of a user's running jobs. If we go with the above, if a job will exceed either limit (`ncores` or `nnodes`), I _believe_ the job should be held until the user goes back under their limit. @ryanday36 should correct me if I am wrong, however....</small>
