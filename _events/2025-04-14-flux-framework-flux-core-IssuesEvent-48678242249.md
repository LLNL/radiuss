<p>view job constraints in `flux jobs`</p><small>I have a low priority feature request. I've had a few occasions lately where I've found myself digging around in the jobspec of individual jobs to see if the user requested specific nodes. I was thinking that it would be nice to have a 'constraints' field available with `flux jobs -o ...` that would display an appropriately joined representation of `jobspec.attributes.system.contstraints`. It would probably also be useful for me if that field were included in the fields displayed by the built-in `-o deps` format (which I find to be generally very useful) and possibly also in the `contextual_info` field....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/6765' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
