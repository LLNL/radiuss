<small>My suggestion here, since I tend to just reach for the familiar, would be to add a couple of columns for queue limits to the `flux resource list` output a la the Slurm sinfo command. Alternatively, a `flux queue list` command could be added that summarizes the resources and limits in each queue....</small>
