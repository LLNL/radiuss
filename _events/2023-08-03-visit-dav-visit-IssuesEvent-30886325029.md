<p>Include darwin-i386 symlinks in macos installs</p><small>See #18865. Cause is an OS install is, for some reason, causing VisIt to look for its binaries in `darwin-i386` instead of `darwin-x86_64`. I think Rosetta may be cause. Maybe we should just create a symlink in the install point as part of our package so that when user's install VisIt, it can find its binary components through either path....</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/18867' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
