<small>@jwake Thanks for your contribution.  The parallel decoding implementation is currently wholly broken and will be rewritten over the coming months.  We're currently re-engineering the block index representation and API, after which we will tackle decompression.  During this time, do not expect the `staging` branch to work correctly until it has been finished and merged into `develop`....</small>
