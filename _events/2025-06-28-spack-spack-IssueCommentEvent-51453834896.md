<small>> I am a Chinese user. From the error message, I think it might be because I used different versions of Git (1.8.3.1 and 2.49.0) simultaneously, which caused some problems. Perhaps I need to completely uninstall Spack and then re-download it. But I'm not sure how to do this without affecting the already installed software....</small>
