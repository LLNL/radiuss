<small>I (1) added all the changes requested, (2) removed the "ir_inner_cusolver" from all relevant files,(3) added the KrylovCudaKernels.cu to CMakeLists. It compiles and links without any issues on PNNL marianas (with cuda 11.4). However, I am getting seg fault with `Address not mapped (1)`Â while running nlpSparseEx1, there is no hiop output and no readable trace. Will continue working on it. @pelesh @nychiang ...</small>
