<a href='https://github.com/biagas' target='_blank'>biagas</a> pushed to <a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit' target='_blank'>visit-dav/visit</a>

<small>Add specific version test to FindVisItVTK.cmake

Only 8.1 in the 8.x series is supported, and only 9.1 in the 9.x series, so make this explicit until newer versions of 9.x are supported.</small>
