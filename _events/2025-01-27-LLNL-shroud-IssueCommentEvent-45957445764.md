<small>I have been trying to support Python 2 for as long as possible, but it's time to finally leave it behind. I plan to make a release in the next month. After that I'm going to make Python 3.7 the minimum version. That will allow me to finally use f-strings and DataClasses as well as update the PyYAML version....</small>
