<small>Ok, finding flux-core by finding flux and matching prefix if it isn't explicitly set implemented.  This allows flux-core to be found by path *even when a different prefix is selected* if the prefix for flux-core isn't explicitly specified.  The order of priority is: FLUX_CORE_PREFIX > PKG_CONFIG_PATH > flux in path > default locations...</small>
