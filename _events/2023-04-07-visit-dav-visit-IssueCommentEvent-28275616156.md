<small>I believe I may have created many of the issues we face with curves today by having taken the approach of treating a **Curve** object as a `vtkRectilinearGrid` where the **Curve** *coordinates* are *always* in the grid's `Xcoords` and the **Curves** *values* are always in the `Ycoords`. Thats just plain wrong. And, it prevents a **Curve** from being treated like we treat any other mesh where the coords are the coords and the values are in points or cells data....</small>
