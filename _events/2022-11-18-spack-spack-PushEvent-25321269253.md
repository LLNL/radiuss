<small>libxml2: make older versions depend on python@:3.9 (#33952)

Add a dependency on python versions less than 3.10 in order to work
around a bug in libxml2's configure script that fails to parse python
version strings with more than one character for the minor version.

The bug is present in v2.10.1, but has been fixed in 2.10.2.
