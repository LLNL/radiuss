<small>Sry, I had the timeline wrong, `VectorCoefficient::Project()` was introduced together its specialization for `VectorGridFunctionCoefficient` in #3066 . The thing is there is no easy way for users to project a vector grid function onto a quadrature function as the specialization `VectorGridFunctionCoefficient::Project()` calls `QuadratureFunction::ProjectGridFunction()`, which has limited applicability (as happened here). While the default implementation of  `VectorCoefficient::Project()` would work perfectly fine in those cases (for performance non-critical applications), but the user is left with an error in a better case or silent failure in the worst. @pazner wanted to look at that some time ago, is it still the case? ðŸ˜‰ ...</small>
