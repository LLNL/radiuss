<small>I started to look into fixing this issue, but got lost fairly quickly. It seems like we need a way to convert an R object without the scheduling key into a jgf representation so it can be passed to the `run()` function to update the graph. It seems like this should be possible using the `rv1exec` reader, then emitting jgf, but I'm unsure of the exact mechanism for that....</small>
