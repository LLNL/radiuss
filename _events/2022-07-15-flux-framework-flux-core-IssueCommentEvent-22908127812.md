<small>The error code  returned from the program is 139 which definitely suggests that it's a `SIGSEGV`. It's still not clear to me what's causing it other than maybe some issue internally to the MPI library that Flux is now using. Interestingly enough, I never ran into this issue when running my old flux workflows that I ran back in November on Summit. I've even tested my old binary from those runs which didn't have any issues then on this new workflow, and I'm seeing the same core dump issue....</small>
