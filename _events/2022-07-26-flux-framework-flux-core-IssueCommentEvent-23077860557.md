<small>@grondo unfortunately `flux pstree` isn't available on y'all's Summit install of flux as that version is only 0.29.0 and it looks like that feature wasn't added until 0.34.0. I've also tried using the `print(flux.resource.list.resource_list(flux_handle).get())` to see if I could print out the resource sets that way but Python complains about `flux.resource.list` not being available. If a more recent version could be installed then I could track down the issue, or if a newer version is available  on Lassen I could try my scripts out on there and see if I can't reproduce the above set of errors....</small>
