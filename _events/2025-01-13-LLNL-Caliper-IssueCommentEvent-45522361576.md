<small>@jessdagostini I've done a bit more work on this. I can get the current version to run on LLNL's Ruby system using PAPI 6.0.0.1. The values I'm getting are not correct right now, but I may not be running long enough to get valid data from PAPI. I'll need to look into that before I can determine if the invalid values are due to the runtime being too short or due to bad logic....</small>
