<small>Oh, and one more comment.  Having the full string in the match means we shouldn't have to assume it's the last line either, so just using the regex.search iterator should find a match on any line; should be safer in case those plugins also allow output after the jobid (would hope not, but easy enough to guard against that)....</small>
