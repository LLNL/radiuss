<small>In those older releases, the path to wgrib2_meta.h was set incorrectly in CMake. It's searching for the header file under the path "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/wgrib2_meta.h". The file is actually written to "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/wgrib2/wgrib2_meta.h". This was fixed in v3.3.0 I believe. ...</small>
