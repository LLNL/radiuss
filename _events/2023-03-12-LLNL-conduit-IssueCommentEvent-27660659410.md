<small>It sounds like this pull request is aimed at extending the Fortran API of Kitware's Catalyst to the level of the C API, making it possible for users to use either API. The work builds on the conventions in the repository and currently covers only certain types, but the author plans to add an Object-Oriented interface similar to the one in conduit_fortran_obj.f90 in the near future....</small>
