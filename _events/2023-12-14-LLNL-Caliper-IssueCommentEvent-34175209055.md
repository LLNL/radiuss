<small>Thanks for the detailed response David.  This clears up some of my questions. I could also track down that the file size literally exploded without setting `CALI_MPI_WHITELIST`/`CALI_MPI_BLACKLIST` . Also the pointer to `CALI_EVENT_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT_INFO` is another thing I missed somehow....</small>
