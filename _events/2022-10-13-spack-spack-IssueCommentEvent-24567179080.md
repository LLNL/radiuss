<small>@scheibelp This is the updated version based on our discussion at the meeting today. I added a new `gitlab-ci:match_behavior` key that determines whether only the first match is applied (`first`, default) or whether all matches are merged in order (`merge`). I've also reverted the changes to the stacks, the only change now is setting `match_behavior: first` in each for clarity....</small>
