<small>> I have one request: is there a way to make the test runs of `ex37` and `ex37p` (for both GNU make and CMake) faster? Maybe use a coarser mesh or just make a few optimization iterations? Currently, the test runs of other example take a few seconds and for `ex37`/`ex37p` they take roughly 2min/1min....</small>
