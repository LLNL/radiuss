<small>With the current configuration, yes, 1.9.8 is the compat bound (see https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/changelog.html#log_1_9_8). If that does not work then we can also tweak the config to some older version. However, I would prefer to update doxygen here if possible, since we already upgrade the docs, also because 1.9.1 is already almost 3 years old and includes a good chunk of bugfixes....</small>
