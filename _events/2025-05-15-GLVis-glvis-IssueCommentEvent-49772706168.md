<small>I have tried headless CI tests with EGL and some pass smoothly, but other fail at initialization. There seems to be some issue on the runners like limited video memory or something on the runners, so it is very random. You may compare [this run](https://github.com/GLVis/glvis/actions/runs/15031953362/job/42306719434) and [this](https://github.com/GLVis/glvis/actions/runs/15031953362/job/42246214799). I have removed the tests and only building with EGL support is done on Ubuntu....</small>
