<small>We now have an implementation that allows specific parameters of jobspec to be updated post-submission, and currently the duration and queue can be updated for pending jobs by users with the `flux update` command. Other attributes can be updated provided a jobtap plugin specifically allows and validates the update. A caveat is that these updates apply only to the instance's redacted copy of the jobspec, and thus the job's command(s) and environment cannot be updated with this solution....</small>
