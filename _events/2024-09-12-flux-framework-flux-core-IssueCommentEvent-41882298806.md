<small>> Another approach might be to develop a format specifier or other indicator that sets the width of a field to the minimum width that would not result in the field being truncated on any line. We do already have the `?:` prefix, so I'm thinking this could be done. Then we could use that in the default format(s) for `flux resource list`....</small>
