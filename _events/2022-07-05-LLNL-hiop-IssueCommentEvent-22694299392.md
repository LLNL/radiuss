<small>@nychiang, as far as I know we used a combination of clang C++ and gcc Fortran compilers to build HiOp with Fortran interface. My understanding is that ROCm bitcode library is specific to the clang intermediate representation and won't work with gcc. If flang is available and mature enough, one should go with that instead of combining different compilers imho. ...</small>
