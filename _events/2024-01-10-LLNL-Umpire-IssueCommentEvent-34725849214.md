<small>Using the flag above has too wide a scope and could end up silencing good warnings from other things. So, we are going to make an external fmt dependency (submodule?). There is a PR being worked on for this https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire/pull/834 and a corresponding PR in radiuss-spack-configs here https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs/pull/79...</small>
