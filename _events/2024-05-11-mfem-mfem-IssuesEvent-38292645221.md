<p>Boundary LF Integrators fast assembly minor bug</p><small>#4027 resolved a seg fault issue in fast assembly of a boundary lf integrator that occurred when a proc in a `ParMesh` does not have any boundary element. The fix in #4027 (causing procs w/o boundary elements to simply return) resolves most cases; however, for some cases, the fix in #4027  is not sufficient. For example, if `EnsureNodes()` was not previously called for the `ParMesh`, then the following calling sequence now ends in a deadlock due to `ParMesh::SetCurvature` attempting to create a new  `ParFiniteElementSpace` which requires all procs of the `ParMesh` (not just the ones owning boundary elements of the `ParMesh`)....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4297' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
