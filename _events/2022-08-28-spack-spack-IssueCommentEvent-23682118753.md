<small>Don't want to mix myself into this unnecessarily (yet I do), but since there is a more recent upstream bugfix version that contains this fix and works with this compiler, can't we simply mark 10.7.2 as a conflict for `gcc@11:` and add in the `msg` that the build issue in 10.7.2 is fixed in 10.7.3? This patch is rather finely targeted to those who specifically want a bugfix release that's not the most recent one....</small>
