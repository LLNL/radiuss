<small>Oh no! But sbatch works? I’m not great with Slurm - can you show me a little batch script that will show the Slurm node rank/hostname and the entire set of hostnames for the batch? You’d need to be able to run the batch script and ssh to the first hostname “broker” to interact with flux. We can try to write a little batch script that will use a config file for flux, and start each broker....</small>
