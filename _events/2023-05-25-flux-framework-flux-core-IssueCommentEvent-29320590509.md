<small>@garlick - Using `I_MPI_PMI_LIBRARY=$(flux getattr conf.pmi_library_path)` fixed a lot of things.  The application now launches and runs to completion.  And now I'm close to even getting it working correctly with Intel 2022.3.0.  But the results are inconsistent from run to run. I still have something wrong somewhere....</small>
