<small>@scottwittenburg I am not able to reproduce this using the cache from `mirrors.spack.io`.  I think we should work through what is missing in #50859 rather than just reverting. It was a fairly small PR so commenting out each section to narrow down what is causing this failure would be better than reverting IMO. I'd be happy to do this with a clearer reproducer....</small>
