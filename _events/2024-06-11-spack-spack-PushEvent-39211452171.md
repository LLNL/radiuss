<small>MFEM: add new version v4.7 (#44010)

* Core change: logic for extracting RPATHs from modules may return
  `None`: filter this out of the set of RPATHs that is auto-generated
* Core change: `CachedCMakePackage` no longer adds ldflags to
  `CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS`: generally these flags are not appropriate
  for static linking (e.g. invocation of `ar`)
* [mfem] Add version 4.7
* [mfem] Add variant for precision (single/double). Enforce consistency
  for precision amongst mfem and hypre/petsc/mumps dependencies
* [mfem] Add cxxstd (and related constraints preventing use of
  old cxxstd values for newer versions of some dependencies)
* [hypre] In line with prior point, added support for specifying
  precision
* [petsc] Add config option to avoid error when building against
  `superlu-dist+rocm`
* [hiop] add proper `raja`/`umpire`/`camp` version constraints for
  `hiop` versions 0.3.99-0.4.x; require `+raja` for `+rocm`, and
  add dependency on `hiprand` for `+rocm`
* [butterflypack, mfem, strumpack, suite-sparse] Require
  `CRAYLIBS_{target-family}` env var to be defined
* [suite-sparse] versions `@7.4:` changed install location of headers:
  add symlink from old location to new location
* [zlib-ng] Fix error where shared libs were not successfully built for
  `%cce@17` (the build did not fail, but the finished `zlib-ng%cce@17`
  install did not have shared libs)</small>
