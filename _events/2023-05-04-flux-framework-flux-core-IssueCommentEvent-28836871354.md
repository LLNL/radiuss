<small>Another item for the list:  I think right now a kvs get always returns the entire value in one message, even if it's stored internally in chunks.  It would be more fair to other messages to make kvs get a streaming rpc that returns sequential chunks, since the other messages could be transferred while the big message is streaming....</small>
