<small>Octopus: branch for Octopus development is now "main" (#34128)

Historically, development of the Octopus code was done on the "develop" branch
on https://gitlab.com/octopus-code/octopus but now development takes place on
"main" (since Q3 2022).

The suggestion in this PR to solve the issue is to keep the spack label
`octopus@develop` as this better indicates this is the development branch on git
than `octopus@main`, but of course to use the `main` branch (there is no choice
here - the `develop` branch is not touched anymore). Sticking to
`octopus@develop` as the version label also keeps backwards compatibility.</small>
