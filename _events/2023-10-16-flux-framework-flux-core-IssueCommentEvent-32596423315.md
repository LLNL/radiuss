<small>FYI - this was causing `SIGILL` when tested before #5504 was merged. (@wihobbs noticed this when running the gitlab ci against just that branch). I'm trying to think of a way we can test this scenario when the local connector is built-in -- perhaps using an old version of the ssh connector from Flux built on this branch?...</small>
