<small>Actually, I went ahead and implemented what I was suggesting, and tested it using your hypre branch. Both approaches seem to work, but the version that uses the hypre headers will preserve the preconditioner options. Please take a look and let me know what you think, but note that to test the option-preserving code path you'll have to bump the hypre version on your hypre branch....</small>
