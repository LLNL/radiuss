<small>@aavbsouza Are you still having issues with zfp's private views and OpenMP?  From our previous discussion, I think TBB is off the table, while the views appear to be working correctly when compiled with OpenMP support.  If this is no longer an issue, then I'd like to go ahead and close it....</small>
