<small>I don't know the pieces you are referring to, but if it's something you can show me (and I'll add into my squashed commit) I'd be happy to do that! Otherwise, if you want to do some custom git history fu / or just add to an additional commit, that works for me too. I revert to whatever you think is best @cmisale @milroy....</small>
