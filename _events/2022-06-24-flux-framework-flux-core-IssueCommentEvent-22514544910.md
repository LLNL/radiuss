<small>My opinion shouldn't matter much here, but I don't find it likely that the KVS sync and heartbeat sync would be confused. I mean the KVS sync related flag is `FLUX_KVS_SYNC` right not just `FLUX_SYNC`? It makes sense that the term sync might be used differently in different contexts. (Though I wouldn't be opposed to renaming `flux_sync_create(3)` to `flux_heartbeat_sync_create(3)`)...</small>
