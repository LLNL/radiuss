<small>> Hi Ken. We have run PFMG on at least hundreds of thousands of cores and thousands of nodes, so there is no issue scaling it up; it's designed to run at massive scales. When you say "scale up", are you talking strong scaling or weak scaling? Strong scaling rolls off more quickly for multigrid methods than with other computations, but it is often still the fastest way to solve a Poisson-like problem (low parallel efficiency does not equal slow time-to-solution). Could you provide us with more details on timings, problem sizes, etc. to demonstrate what you mean here? Thanks!...</small>
