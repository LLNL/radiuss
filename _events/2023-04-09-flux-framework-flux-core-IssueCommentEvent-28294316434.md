<small>Reading about conda forge I see that it uses a sysroot that is currently based on CentOS 6 (!?). I think that _might_ be the issue, though I could be misunderstanding since it seems surprising that conda would be based on CentOS 6 since I think that distro was EOL in 2020. However, can you try to forcethe sysroot to centos 7 with these instructions?...</small>
