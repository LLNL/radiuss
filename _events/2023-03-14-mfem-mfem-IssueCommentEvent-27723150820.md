<small>Thank you @vladotomov! I think my problem arises from shared nodes resulting from parallel calculations. I added source terms equal to the number of degrees of freedom. In parallel mode, I believe the source term is being used twice. Therefore, I attempted to reduce the number of source terms by half for shared nodes. Do you have any suggestions on how to identify the shared nodes between processors?...</small>
