<p>Add documentation on adding ffmpeg to an installation.</p><small>Ffmpeg is a movie encoder that encodes high quality mpeg 4 movies. If VisIt finds it in the path, then it will use ffmpeg when using the movie wizard or visit_utils. It's possible to add ffmpeg to the VisIt installation if it isn't available to everyone by default. This should be documented in the "Installing and Starting VisIt" section of the manual, probably right before the "Startup options" section....</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/18803' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
