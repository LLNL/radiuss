<small>@milroy I've been looking into this. I didn't find any documentation specific to golang/cgo and autotools but I think we could try to figure that out by trial and error. The main problem I see is that there's nothing to build really. It's not a library or a binary, we just include the files in the code that needs to use it. We do have an example, `main.go`, that we can build but it's a dummy code. ...</small>
