<p>MLI Package with cmake configuration</p><small>Hi, I am trying to enable the original smoothed aggregation method in MLI package. The manual shows it can be used with the IJ interface as a black-box method. How can I do this with cmake? Seems `HYPRE_LSI_MLISetParams` comes from the FEI interface and does not support cmake configuration....</small><a href='https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/issues/756' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
