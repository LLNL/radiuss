<small>@da-wad thank you for catching this, not sure how that ended up in there. There were some zfpy test build issues and this was done while figuring them out. It looks more like a snapshot from when we were in the middle of modifying setup.py while debugging though and not anything meant to be committed. I'm not sure how it made it through but it should probably be reverted. Not sure what the best way to do that is since it is technically in the 1.0.1 release....</small>
