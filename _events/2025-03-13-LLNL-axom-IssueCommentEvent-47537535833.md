<small>@white238 @bmhan12 @rhornung67 @kennyweiss @gunney1 I added an example in Lumberjack called `lumberjack_noncollective_messages_ex` that represents a typical use case where a non-collective root communicator is needed to log error messages.  I attempted to re-create the same set of conditions encountered in the host code of interest, but it is still somewhat simplified.  I try to emphasize what this example is supposed to illustrate with the detailed comments in the source code (see `nonCollectiveMessagesExample.cpp`).  Feel free to let me know if you have any thoughts/suggestions....</small>
