<small>I'd have put in a conflict if a newer compatible version of `spdlog` was already available (because patches are more 'expensive' to maintain). Because of the interface changes it is possible that other projects will start requiring `fmt@10:` and without a patch that could introduce concretization conflicts in unified environments....</small>
