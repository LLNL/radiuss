<small>Looking forward to it. Regarding `IterativeSolverController`, it is very easy. The solver calls `MonitorSolution()`, which gets the intermediate solution and the only thing to implement is evaluation of the norm. If it is lower than your desired threshold, just indicate convergence by setting `converged = true`. The solver checks that and ends the calculation. That is it ðŸ˜‰ ....</small>
