<small>I'm not sufficiently familiar with HDF5 and how such flags might impact the average user, but I suspect many (most?) zfp binary installations--and there are lots of them in the form of prebuilt [Linux](https://repology.org/project/zfp/versions), [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/zfp), and [Spack](https://packages.spack.io/package.html?name=zfp) packages--will use the default 64-bit setting.  If the user has to explicitly request filter bypass, then I think allowing that would be fine.  But is there any chance that filter failure might occur at load time unbeknownst to the user?...</small>
