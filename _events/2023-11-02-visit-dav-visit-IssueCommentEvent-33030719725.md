<small>https://github.com/ospray/ospray/issues/573 could be related, the symptoms sure are similar. I'll hop back on that VTK issue tomorrow. When I poked at it last time the OSPRay build itself was working (it's tests and examples were fine), but Kitware's ParaView build also produced blank images like yours. My two guesses are something related to blending of the ospray framebuffer onto the VTK Renderer/layer or something wrong related to runtime library linking....</small>
