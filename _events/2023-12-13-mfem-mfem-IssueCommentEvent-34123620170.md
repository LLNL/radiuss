<small>There are some good points made about the type name. My only strong opinion is that it should not contain an underscore, because we will have to type this name many times, and underscores are really annoying to type. I would also prefer all lower-case, for the same reason. Since `real` can cause issues, `scalar` sounds good to me. Also, `fptype` is fine with me :)...</small>
