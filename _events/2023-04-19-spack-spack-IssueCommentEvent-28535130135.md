<small>@kwryankrattiger, unfortunately there are conflicts on this patch when applying to sensei 4|4.1, I went ahead and resolved these conflicts and created a new patch that only works with 4/4.1 which should work. On the other hand, there is no way to submit this upstream since it appears that sensei does not maintain releases....</small>
