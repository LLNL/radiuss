<p>Bug in Curl calculation for HDiv on higher order hexahedra</p><small>This issue is a minimum working example of a bug with HDiv spaces on quadratic hexahedra elements. This is demonstrated using a hexahedral mesh of a cylinder cavity, and modification of ex13p to form a discrete curl matrix to calculate the B field (curl E) for each eigenmode, and modification of the visualization to report the curl E....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3640' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
