<p>Thread safety for `MemoryManager`</p><small>Unfortunately, trying to allocate any form of `Memory` in a shared-memory parallel region using any memory type other than `HOST` does not work. I believe this is due to race conditions on the `static internal::Maps` and `static internal::Ctrl` objects used in `mem_manager.cpp`, but even trying to make all operations critical/thread-safe I was unable to avoid errors about unregistered addresses or similar. The reason this is annoying is that it means we can't build MFEM with Umpire support, or use unified memory, or even use the debug memory type when building MFEM with OpenMP support and having parallel regions which allocate thread-private memory....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4106' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
