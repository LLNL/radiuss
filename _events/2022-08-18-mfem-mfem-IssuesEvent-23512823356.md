<p>Updating grid function coefficients every time step</p><small>I am trying to implement perfectly matched layer boundary conditions in a time-domain simulation (see Jin, "The Finite Element Method in Electromagnetics").  I am trying to use the overall PML concept within a E/B update framework similar to the maxwell miniapp.  After some derivations, there are extra terms in the time-dependent update equation (time derivative of E), whose weak form is:...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3156' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
