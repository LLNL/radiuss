<small>@JustinPrivitera thanks for considering all my questions. I think one or two concerns still exist but they are not resolvable here either and I think the merge can proceed without introducing any new issues and without those concerns being addressed as long as we talk about them at an upcoming project meeting. Those are a) what to do about the different VTK array types in the case where we call the ExchangeData and b) What to do about the linear exhaustive search for domain ids....</small>
