<small>new Mult function included in IPSolver so that the user does not need to be aware of the variable for which the bound-constraints are applied m >= ml, this is useful for contact mechanics problems wherein the bound-constraint variable is actually a slack variable and will not be especially important to the user. obstacleProblem.cpp is now cleaned up a bit, there is no longer a need to create a BlockVector and use this as input to the Mult IPM solution call and so it has been removed in favor of just working with a Vector representation of the primal variable</small>
