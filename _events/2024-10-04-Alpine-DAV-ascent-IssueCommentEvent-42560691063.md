<small>@devilkingsatan666 I've duplicated this bug and it is definitely a weird one. For some reason all of the text from the cinema files are being appended to index.html. As a temporary workaround, if you copy a clean version of index.html or delete all the appended text (all text after the </html> on line 56), you should be able to view your database in the browser. https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/c11da70c958bd9cdcc5d49eacbbc13c95a48ecef/src/libs/ascent/web_clients/cinema/index.html...</small>
