<small>It looks to me like the zoom behavior in Ascent is different from VTKm. There must be a logic in Ascent that converts the Ascent behavior to VTKm behavior. I believe the VTKm documentation is actually correct. I also think that the VTKm zoom is cumulative, so doing a zoom of 1 twice (VTKm zoom behavior) results in zooming in more the second time....</small>
