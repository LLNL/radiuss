<small>In general, FFS and the software stack above it (EVPath, SST and ADIOS) work fine without libffi.  If it finds libffi additional features are enabled in ffs, but those features are not necessary or useful to the ADIOS software stack.  Newer releases of FFS default to not looking for libffi because the sometimes-dependency has caused trouble....</small>
