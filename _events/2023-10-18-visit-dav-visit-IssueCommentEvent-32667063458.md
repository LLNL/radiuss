<small>@markcmiller86 I ran VisIt last night and this morning an orphaned VCL was still hanging around the cluster. I forgot to add `-pid` to the run, but this was the only VisIt instance I ran and I removed the old vlogs from the directory, so I know these are attached to the orphaned instance. I will run another instance with `-pid` if it would be helpful as well. ...</small>
