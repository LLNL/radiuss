<small>Dear @victorapm , thank you for letting me know. I can't seem to get the GPU-aware MPI working in my HYPRE application. It certainly works on the cluster (for my other codes), but not when used with HYPRE. It would really help me to have a simple example that has been successfully tested with GPU-aware MPI. Then I can ask the cluster support to work out (possible) compiler issues etc....</small>
