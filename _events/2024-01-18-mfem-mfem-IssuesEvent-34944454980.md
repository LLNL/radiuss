<p>Add Line heat sinks within control volume while solving a 3D thermal problem</p><small>I am trying to solve the 3D steady state heat conduction problem with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. But additionally, I also have line heat sources/sinks within the 3D solid. The heat source is thin and parameterized with a B-spline but its not included in the thermal solvers mesh. I am not sure how to set it up. Any help is appreciated. Thank you ...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4072' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
