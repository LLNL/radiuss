<p>Rubber banding zoom lines do not show up properly with 3.4.0.</p><small>I tried out rubber band zooming a 2d image and only a couple of the lines showed up when doing the zooming. This is an issue on toss4 and blueos. The toss4 version is using Qt 6.4.2 and the blueos version is using Qt5.14.2, so it doesn't appear to be a Qt version issue....</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/19094' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
