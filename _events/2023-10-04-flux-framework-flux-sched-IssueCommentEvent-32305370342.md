<small>We support it though. That’s what I was getting at earlier. Spack does it by default for cmake, and that’s what we want. For auto tools it doesn’t because many auto tools projects break with a separate build root. In our case all flux projects build either in tree or out of tree, and I always build all of them out of tree, so I see no reason to override it unless we want to override the unnecessary in-tree auto tools default....</small>
