<small>Hi @jvwilliams23. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It looks like you're building without Aluminum support. Aluminum is recommended for nearly every situation nowadays, and, indeed, it will become a requirement soon. In the meantime, this should work, so I'll put up a patch. To get you going sooner, you might try `^hydrogen@develop+al`....</small>
