<small>And @trws one more question for you I was thinking about just now - does qmanager hold some memory of jobs out until eternity? I know I can easily see finished job stats, but I don't see that logic with qmanager, so I'm guessing that belongs somewhere with kvs / job manager? Apologies I haven't read the code yet - been doing nothing most of today and kind of digging that too :P Happy Sunday!...</small>
