<small>Just wanted to add that I tried to work around this in a real application by rounding all allocations to the alignment before passing them to Umpire and I still get reallocations every iteration, so that on its own might not explain the reallocation. I may also have made a mistake of course... But thought I'd mention this for a possible fix in Umpire....</small>
