<small>Another idea would be to add this functionality as partial specializations of the existing `make_view` function, and get rid of the `ReShape` object entirely. What's implemented here is a way to create both permuted and non-permuted Views, so the functionality is generic enough to sit under the `make_view` umbrella....</small>
