<small>bugfix: unit test broken everywhere by package change(#46344)

Openmpi provider statements were changed in #46102. The package change
was fine in and of itself, but apparently one of our tests depends on
the precise constraints used in those statements. I updated the test
to remove the checks for constraints that were removed.</small>
