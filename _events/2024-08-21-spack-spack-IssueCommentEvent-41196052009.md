<small>@oliviermattelaer What would help the most here, for spack, is if we could keep the last numbered version instead of removing them when lts is created. So, for example, https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/2.0/2.9.x/+download/MG5_aMC_v2.9.19.tar.gz should remain valid even when that version becomes https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/lts/2.9.x/+download/MG5_aMC_v2.9.19.tar.gz. That seems to be the most disruptive part of the versioning strategy, that when lts is decide it's a directory move, not a copy....</small>
