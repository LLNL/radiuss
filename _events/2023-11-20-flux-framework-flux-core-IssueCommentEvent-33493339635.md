<small>So I have yet to figure out the exact login/profile/rc file runes that are leading to the situation described above and affecting tests.  However, I think setting F58_FORCE_ASCII appears to be the right choice, as it'll lead to consistent output of `$id` and `$id1`, thus leading to correct grepping....</small>
