<small>Hi Tim, based on your log, I suggest you do `set_alpha_min(1e3)` for the hiopAlgPrimalDecomp class object and see if the results improve. I need to add in general however, neither primal decomp nor exago is implemented in a way that guarantees convergence. So there could be issues with difficult cases. Thank you!...</small>
