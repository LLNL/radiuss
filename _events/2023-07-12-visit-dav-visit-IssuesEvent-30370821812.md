<p>Symlog scaling</p><small>It would be very useful if alongside the Linear, Log and Skew one could set symmetric log scales for plots like pseudocolor. The use case is for variables spanning exponential ranges both in the negative and positive domain, which can be plotted on a diverging colorscale with log scaling applied to the positive and negative parts, and linear scaling across a small interval straddling zero, either set by a value or a percentage of the min/max. It can be constructed with thresholds and separate plots for the positive and negative portions separately, but an automatic feature would be awesome....</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/18827' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
