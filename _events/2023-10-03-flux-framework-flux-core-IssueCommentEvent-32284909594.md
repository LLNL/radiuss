<small>Good idea @grondo. @garlick I tried the same thing as Mark but varied the number of nodes, and put some nested instances in there, and tried using `flux uri slurm:jobid` both in and out of the session. This is reminding me of when the LSF resolver broke because I got an allocation on `lassen9-11` and the command in LSF sorted `lassen10` as the rank 0 node due to the `1` being a lower number than `9`...could be a really weird one off case like that. In any event, good idea to add that to our testing on real clusters....</small>
