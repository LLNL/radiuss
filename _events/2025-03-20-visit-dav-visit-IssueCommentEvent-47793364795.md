<small>I think you will need to build without swr to truely get the newer instructions out of VisIt. I don't think it's critical since I don't think we use it by default. I vaguely recall you need to set an environment variable to enable it. Furthermore, swr support was removed from Mesa back in December 2021, so we will need to remove it at some point if we move to a newer Mesa....</small>
