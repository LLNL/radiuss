<small>Using `git = ssh://git@github.com:spack/spack.git"` should work (i.e. prepending `ssh://`. I assume @tldahlgren that's what you mean by a quick fix, which AFAIK is expected - @benpm I assume you have ssh keys configured for git interaction, but let me know if prepending `ssh://` does not produce a satisfactory result....</small>
