<small>We typically don't build with werror when our build also builds samrai libs, but this seems to resulting from including a [cpp file from a header](https://github.com/LLNL/SAMRAI/blob/master/source/SAMRAI/pdat/ArrayData.h#L751), that and we updated our CI to new OS (fedora 36) so newer compiler with different werror triggers...</small>
