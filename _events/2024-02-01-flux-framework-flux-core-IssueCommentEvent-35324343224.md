<small>If we had a "reserved" state, possibly with either soft or hard semantics, we might also be able to use that to show it has been given a prospective start time by the scheduler.  This is a bit of an idle thought while I'm in an OpenMP meeting, so it might not match super well, but if we could get both a nicer interface for DATs and have a way to surface predicted starts for jobs other than the next that would make users happy....</small>
