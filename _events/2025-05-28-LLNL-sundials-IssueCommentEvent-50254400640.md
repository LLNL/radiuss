<small>Yes, there are other ODEs for those two equations as well (algebraic for voltage veq and differential for current ieq). I've put diagnostics into my residual callback and notice that the residual for the energy equation eeq is quite high (10000 compared to 1.0e-13 for others) when the solver fails...</small>
