<small>> Also, I should mention that you may want to resist making changes to `DofTransformation`. I'm preparing a PR (#3379) which makes some significant changes to these classes in order to expose a bit of their inner workings. I'll take a closer look at what you've done here and see if I can incorporate your changes into this other PR....</small>
