<small>We'll have to figure out if there are any extra constraints since the queue constraints are applied to any existing constraints with "and" in the job frobnicator. Possibly it may have been better to keep the system-applied constraints separate from the user supplied constraints in jobspec, to make this easier. For now, job-list may have to compare the signed jobspec vs the job-manager's possibly modified jobspec....</small>
