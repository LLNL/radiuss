<small>@wdconinc absolutely! mainly I focused on trimming down the dependency lists on the base to match the actual usage based on the CMakeCache and CMakeLists in Qt. If I recall correctly one of the blockers was that I wasn't able to disable ssl; and some of the variants are unsupported/low-level switches in the cmake that might change from one minor version to the next....</small>
