<small>This isn't critical path for any project work since ECP came to and end, and so I don't think we are going to get to testing this anytime soon. I assume that this issue can be closed given your reports, and we can re-open any issues that we might have found with ROCm 5.6.0/6.0.0 as necessary...</small>
