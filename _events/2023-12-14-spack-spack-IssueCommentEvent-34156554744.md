<small>Hey @kuberry, in addition to @eugeneswalker having it fail in https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/38569. I am having the same issue `xyce +mpi +shared +pymi +pymi_static_tpls` on gcc@11.2.1, rocky8, x86_64, using the e4s-23.11-gcp-mvapich2-sock branch of eugeneswalker/spack. I figured since the issue was showing up on different o.s's and compilers, the relevant patch for it should just be implemented for all builds....</small>
