<small>> I guess I wasn't thrilled with the SQL query change that I had to look up (because I am a complete SQL noob), given that the index probably isn't necessary given the expected small size of the query result. Easier to just filter it on the client side IMHO. We own the clients and servers as well as the convenience API (internal only), so I think we could change it all we want. But if you feel strongly, this is OK I guess. We can always fix it later....</small>
