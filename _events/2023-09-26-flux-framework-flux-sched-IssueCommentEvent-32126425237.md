<small>That makes sense, unfortunately it looks like the change was made in the runner image, see here: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/8238 on September 18th. It looks like the other ubuntu image does not support python 3.6 either, so I am not sure if there is a better alternative?  ...</small>
