<small>@tzanio this was my thought as well. However, I discussed with @cyrush, and he felt it would be better to bring the VisIt outputs in closer parity with the Conduit outputs, which do not handle the quadrature function case and _do_ include the basis name. We can wait for him to chime in if you'd like, or organize a time to meet and discuss....</small>
