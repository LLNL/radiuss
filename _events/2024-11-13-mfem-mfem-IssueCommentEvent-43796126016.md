<small>Cool, @mdavids-cfs , there is a big difference between the poor Gauss-Seidel and a multi-grid (BoomerAMG), as the residuum shows, but both did not converge. It is good for regression using plain `DarcyForm`, so we know it works the same way as `master`. However, the main benefit is that you may use turn on hybridization (`-hb`, works for RTs or DGs) or reduction of the DG flux (`-rd`) ðŸ˜® (I just added that reduction to `ex5-hdg.cpp`). Does that work?...</small>
