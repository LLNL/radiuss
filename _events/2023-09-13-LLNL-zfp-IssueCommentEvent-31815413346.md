<small>Yes, essentially it just needs a new release with the new binaries uploaded. The previous version of them suffered from a mistake I made while building manually. The wheels are built with oldest-supported-numpy (and so are compatible with future numpy versions) but no longer require using the oldest supported numpy version during installation....</small>
