<small>Thanks for the suggestion.  I doubt that we have access to the same compiler/OS/hardware setup, so debugging this from our end will be challenging.  AppVeyor supports Visual Studio Community 2022 version 17.5.0.  We can take a look and see if the issue can be reproduced with that compiler, though it seems unlikely as the issue seems confined to one particular compiler version and system....</small>
