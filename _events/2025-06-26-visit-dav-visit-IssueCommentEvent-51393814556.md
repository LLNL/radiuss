<small>Some underlying code must have changed or been deleted as not setting a back-end will look to see if the`ANARI_LIBRARY` environment variable is set and it that's not set you should get a pop-up requesting a valid back-end to be specified. VisIt should not crash when a back-end isn't set and those scenarios were tested. I'll take a look and see what has changed....</small>
