<small>Hi @JacobLotz, thank you for the explanation. It is acceptable to create a PR that only adds some utility functions without an example. If it is easy to make a small example, that would help the review process and to show users how to take advantage of the new features. Overall, MFEM does not have many NURBS examples, and of course this PR is not to blame. We should add more examples in `miniapps/nurbs`, especially for mesh generation. So far, MFEM only demonstrates how to use input NURBS meshes, without showing how to generate NURBS meshes. You are welcome to add some examples for your PRs, and I noticed one of your PRs does, but it is not required. We can proceed with the review, and you can simultaneously add examples if you wish....</small>
