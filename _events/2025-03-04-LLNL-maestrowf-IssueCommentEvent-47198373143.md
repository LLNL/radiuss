<small>Hey Charles, Thanks for adding this issue! I think a lot of folks could benefit from this. I have several users (myself included) who are interested in breaking out pieces of their workflows into separate specifications, with one primary "driver" spec that links them all together. This would also allow users to own and maintain their specific models while allowing for a simpler handoffs of multi-step workflows....</small>
