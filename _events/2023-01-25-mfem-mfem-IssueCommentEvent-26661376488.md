<small>@ianabel my plan would be to merge it at some point. Before the holidays, I pushed some changes, but they were not well-tested. I wanted to polish them a little more but got swamped with work. Also, there are modifications to the linear/bilinear forms and the gridfunction classes, not directly related to the initial hdg examples. So maybe those should be in a different pull request....</small>
