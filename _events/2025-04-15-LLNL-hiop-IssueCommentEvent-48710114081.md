<small>I am including some plots here which constitutes the tests of the added capabilities. I modified the BODriverEX.py to one without constraints besides the bound constraints. I ran 10 BO iterations using with a batch size of 2 and using the various strategies. I repeated experiments 10 times and compare against mean behavior of EI with a batch size of 1. The error bars show the variance in the repeated experiments. The horizontal axis is the number of batches, so there are twice as many function evaluations with `q=2` then with `q=1` (see plot legend)....</small>
