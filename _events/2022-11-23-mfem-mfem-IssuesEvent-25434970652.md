<p>Opinions on switching from `astyle` to `clang-format`?</p><small>PETSc and libCEED moved recently to use `clang-format` for more consistent code styling (see https://github.com/CEED/libCEED/issues/1047, https://github.com/CEED/libCEED/pull/1051), and it seems like with more an more contributing developers MFEM could also benefit from this. Are there any opinions on making a similar switch in MFEM? That is, assuming there is a `.clang-format` style which satisfy everyone close enough to the current Artistic Style guidelines....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3339' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
