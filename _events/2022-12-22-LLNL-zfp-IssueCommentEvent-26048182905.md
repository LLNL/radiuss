<small>Really all that's needed is support for 64-bit signed and unsigned integer types by the compiler (even if done through emulation) that produces binaries that can be executed on the target platform.  I think OS support is a bit of a red herring as `libzfp` itself should not depend on it.  I don't know how 32-bit ARM handles 64-bit integer arithmetic....</small>
