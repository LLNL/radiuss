<small>Enabled the CosmoFlow integration test to run in the distconv CI (#2400)

* Enabled the CosmoFlow integration test to run in the distconv CI
branches.  Updated the CosmoFlow target metrics.  Removed CI code to
cleanup build directorys that would have spurious failures when the
downstream CI tasks ran with different agents.  Additionally, it
became unnecessary when CI was allowed to cleanup the entire
directory.

* Adjust the range.

* Removed CI cleanup code because it may be causing destructive
interference between runs.  Adjusted CosmoFlow rangers.

* Adjusting the timing on Tioga.

* Update model/train config and target losses

* Extending the ranges for Tioga.

* Moved the Lassen test to the special CI queue (pci). Updated the mini-batch time on pascal.
