<small>silo: variant python needs python (#48257)

* silo: variant python needs python

* Dependency to Python did not resolve the "Python.h" header not being found

Added the -I path to Python header to the compiler.
Having silo depend on python was not sufficient to get the path to python.
Maybe there is a smarter way to do that, but this one works.
