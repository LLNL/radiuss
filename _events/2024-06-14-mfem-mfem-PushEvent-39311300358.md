(cherry picked from commit 9412dac5c4dde84732d2f8e82787eac3f9e48906)

* Added ExodusII Wedge6 test case.

(cherry picked from commit 0e69f28a5f357fc44d22f52b1cd5f7a63e492b2b)

* Added Pyramid5 support.

(cherry picked from commit 679b1e4c3f9298513627d27ea130b5e87b80350c)

(cherry picked from commit 2f90b786a0228892f76f926af5e0fe04ab741977)

* Commented-out Wedge6 and Pyramid5 tests since the files cannot be read until ReadCubit is updated in a separate PR.

* Removed unused dimension definition; Added support for writing mixed first-order meshes.

(cherry picked from commit 4c111d6f9198f418d32df98fd5e711455f73170a)

* Commented-out test cases that cannot be run with existing ReadCubit ExodusII reader.

* Added CreateEmptyFile, WriteTitle and WriteNumOFElements methods.

* Added database/api versions, floating point word size, max line/name lengths.

* writing element block parameters now handled in class method.

* Sideset information now stored inside class.

* writing nodal variables is now done in a method.
