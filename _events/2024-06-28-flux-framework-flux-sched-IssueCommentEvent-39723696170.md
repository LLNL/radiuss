<small>Fun new facts, this _did_ work, but there's an ordering bug that's exposed by this linked above.  Once that lands, this should be all green, and no longer spins.  I would recommend any side testing with this branch to be done with the flux-core change in flux-framework/flux-core#6062 in case you're looking @milroy....</small>
