<small>Good points.  Yes, I think checking for N+1 and then messaging the user about it is probably the way to go.  Having a simple `flux jobs` query take some number of minutes to return because it's looping through the set of all jobs since the dawn of creation might have bad effects on my blood pressure....</small>
