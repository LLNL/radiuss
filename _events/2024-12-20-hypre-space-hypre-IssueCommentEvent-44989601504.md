<small>Okay, this is all good now.  Autotest is fixed and tested as well.  I've removed all mention of 'cmbuild' in the repo except for one occurence in `cmake.bat` that we aren't using and I have no way to test right now anyway.  Thanks for all the nice work here!  This is going to be awesome!...</small>
