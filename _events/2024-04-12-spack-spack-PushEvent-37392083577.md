<small>Allow packages to be pushed to build cache after install from source (#42423)

This commit adds a property `autopush` to mirrors. When true, every source build is immediately followed by a push to the build cache. This is useful in ephemeral environments such as CI / containers.

To enable autopush on existing build caches, use `spack mirror set --autopush <name>`. The same flag can be used in `spack mirror add`.</small>
