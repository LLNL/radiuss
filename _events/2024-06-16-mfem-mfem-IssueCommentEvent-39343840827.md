<small>Hi @psocratis ,    in the lines between 79 and 81, there is PML formulation for the Helmoltz equation.   Would it be possible to provide a reference to this equation? In the line 119,  there is reference for ultra week DPG,  but seems not for PML.  Thank you very much in advance. ...</small>
