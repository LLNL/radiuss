<small>Thank you for your response. After carefully studying examples 10 and 17, I realized that they are not very helpful for my needs, which I may not have explained clearly. I am interested in simulating the propagation of two-dimensional seismic waves using the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in MFEM. Typically, this involves representing the two-dimensional elastic wave equation as a first-order hyperbolic system of velocity-stress equations, and then solving it using the DG method....</small>
