<small>Yeah, maybe the env vars could just be queried to check the flux version and choose the appropriate wrappers at import time?  Don't think having to update the pypi package along with flux is much of a burden, though if that same newest package could still support at least a few older flux versions that'd probably be useful?  Could be a nightmare for users if they have to poke through the package history to find the one that works for a specific flux install (though maybe there's some python packaging magic that can make that easier for pip to just figure out or something?).  ...</small>
