<small>My only other advice is when/if you change your `.clang-format`, it should be the only thing happening in the PR (i.e., don't mix changing the format with other coding changes). The formatting will change so many files that the other code changes will either slip under the radar or it will force the reviewer to carefully scan through all the changes looking for the substantial ones....</small>
