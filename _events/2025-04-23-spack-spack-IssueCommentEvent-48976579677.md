<small>Only thing I'm a bit on the fence about is `lib/spack/spack/schema/buildcache_spec.py`. It doesn't really add much, so the "mediaType" might as well just be ordinary `spec` instead of `buildcache_spec`. Then `schema/spec.py` should have `"additionalProperties": true` at the root....</small>
