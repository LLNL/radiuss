<small>And to discuss some planning, I'm hoping to start work on moving the go bindings out of tree after we are merged here, and after that continue work on fluence. I'm going to start from the same git history and be very careful to rename / move so that the original authors / commits are preserved. It would be really great if we could finish this one up today (and then I could work over the weekend) but if that's not possible it's ok too....</small>
