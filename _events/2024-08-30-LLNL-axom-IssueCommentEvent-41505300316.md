<small>Ok @kennyweiss I think I've made (almost) all of the changes you suggested. The only one I haven't touched yet is the Sina versioning but we should continue the discussion on that in the [thread above](https://github.com/LLNL/axom/pull/1378#discussion_r1739451970). Other than that everything should be good to go here now (so long as all of the tests pass again)....</small>
