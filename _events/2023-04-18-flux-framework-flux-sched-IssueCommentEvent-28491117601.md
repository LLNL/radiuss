<small>hi @dupgit thanks for the fixes.  However, I think most of these were intentionally skipped in prior PRs.  The typos come from code we copied in from other projects, so we are working to get the typos fixed in those projects, and then we can bring them in via an update to that code.  See #1026....</small>
