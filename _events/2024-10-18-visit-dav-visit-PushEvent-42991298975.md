<small>Remove use of HAVE_SNPRINTF (#19913)

* Remove use of HAVE_SNPRINTF

It was being used with scripting libraries to prevent python from #defining snprintf as _snprintf. This is no longer necessary with the python version we are currently using on Windows.

Modified GenerateCMake.h, and regenerated plots/operators CMakeLists.txt

* Remove HAVE_SNPRINTF</small>
