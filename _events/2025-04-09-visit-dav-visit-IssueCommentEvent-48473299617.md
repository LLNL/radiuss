<small>As I've looked at this more, we have a number of places in GUI where font can be set to one of `Arial`, `Courier` or `Times` (this restriction is a hold over from earlier implementations of VTK I think where only 3 integer values were supported to specify a font family. Now, VTK supports any TrueType (`.ttf`) file paths....</small>
