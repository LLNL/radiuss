<small>Honestly, I'm seriously considering saying we should just have a global (or class static maybe) instance that we use for stats.  It's global context.  Much as I still feel the pangs of the classic "global state is evil" this is a case where even if we go multi-threaded, I think I would still want it to be global and just add some atomics....</small>
