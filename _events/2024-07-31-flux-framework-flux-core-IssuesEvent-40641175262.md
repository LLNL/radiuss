<p>flux resource list doesn't display queue name when there are 0 resources in a state</p><small>`flux resource list` appears to list all possible states, but if there are no nodes in a given state, it doesn't list a queue name (or node list) for that state. At least, I think that's the issue. This can be a bit confusing. I would argue that it would be better to just not list the state if there are no nodes in that state, or to list all of the queues to show that there are 0 nodes in that state in any queues....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/6166' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
