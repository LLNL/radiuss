<small>buildcache push: ensure bool arguments for include_* (#35632)

Fixes a bug introduced in 44ed0de8c077630148c213d3c7f40a8965eb6f94
where the push method of binary_distribution now takes named args
include_root and include_depedencies, to avoid the **kwarg hole.

But the call site wasn't update and we passed a dict of keys/values instead
of arguments, which resulted in a call like this:

```
push(include_root={"include_root": True, "include_dependencies": False})
```

This commit fixes that, and adds a test to see if we push the correct packages.</small>
