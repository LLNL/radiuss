<p>Adding a constraint which is integral of the gridfunction over a subdomain</p><small>I want to compute the AC current density distribution in a wire passing 1 ampere (electromagnetic skin effect). To do so I used the equation of magnetic vector potential in 2D (assume the wire is long and straight). The proper equation is solved in example 22 prob 1, -Div(a Grad u) - omega^2 b u + i omega c u = 0. In example 22 there is boundary conditions but in my case I would like to enforce "integral(-i omega sigma u) = 1" so that the current is 1A and get rid of the Dirichlet conditions....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4584' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
