<small>> This fix does introduce a problem with the RT space. I've also looked at ND spaces and seen no issues there yet. I acknowledge that support for H1 spaces may be more urgent than ND and RT. If we choose to merge this fix before resolving the RT issue I'll create a separate PR focused on ND and RT support....</small>
