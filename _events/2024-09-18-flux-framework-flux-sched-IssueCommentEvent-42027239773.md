<small>OK, tests are failing, but I think it's generally working properly--the flux-coral2 testsuite runs successfully with the JGF generated from this branch. So remaining work is eliminating the `path` fields (which will require looking at edges, not sure how to do this yet) and then getting the tests to pass....</small>
