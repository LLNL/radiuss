<small>Looking at this again the tests do appear to be currently enabled for recent rocm versions. I thought we disabled them because the tests were failing with newer rocm versions. However they are disabled specifically for older rocm versions and are enabled for newer rocm versions. I think this is appropriate so I'm closing this issue....</small>
