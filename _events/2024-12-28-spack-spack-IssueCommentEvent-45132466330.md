<small>I think people want to be able to install compilers from build cache, that's all. Even without compilers as nodes, it is useful to be able to quickly get a compiler toolchain from cache. Now that we are actually building binaries that are widely installable via our new CI container images, we are in a position to actually offer this. Whenever we can do that will be good, whether that is now or in a few months when other relevant features mature. Whatever is best....</small>
