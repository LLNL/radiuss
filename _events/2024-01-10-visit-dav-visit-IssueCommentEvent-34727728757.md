<small>I mean, I am just testing the Silo output to make sure that work elsewhere in the code has not mucked with the results.  In the context of end-to-end testing of a feature that I would generally expect to not be _too_ sensitive to things going on in other parts of the code, sampling a few spatial points at some/all of the plot states seems like a sensible thing to do.  If you think this is . . . excessive in some way, or maybe open to some optimization that I haven't considered, lets discuss offline....</small>
