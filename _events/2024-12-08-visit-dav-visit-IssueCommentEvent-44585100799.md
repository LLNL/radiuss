<small>> @cssherman, couple of questions. I know the examples are probably very small samples. Just wondering if there are ever multiple blocks with 'Level' in the name, eg 'Level0', 'Level1' etc. Also, will the root file always be a `.pvd` file with timestate files always in `.vtm`? Trying to work out how to distinguish your flavor of VTK from generic so VisIt can present your data in the best possible manner....</small>
