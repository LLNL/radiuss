<small>Ok, this should be good to go now I hope.  It's notable that the first commit, the one that's a move and one line, is all it takes to install the script.  The second commit is required for `flux-ion-resource` to pass pylint, it was in pretty tough shape and this was the minimum to make it pass (almost, bit of extra cleanup too)....</small>
