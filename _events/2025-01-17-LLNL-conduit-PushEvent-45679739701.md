<small>Add example of enhanced and reduced connectivity (#1316)

This PR adds bent_multi_grid() as a way to produce a multi-grid mesh, either 3D or 2D, that includes enhanced and reduced connectivity points between the blocks.  The blocks are Cartesian structured grids.  Also adds linear interpolation as a blueprint utility.
