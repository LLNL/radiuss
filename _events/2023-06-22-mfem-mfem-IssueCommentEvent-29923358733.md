<small>Thank you @jandrej @kmittal2 , this is very helpful to me. I also have a question with the performance improvement in my case. I want to prestore/extract the interpolation matrix so that only sparse matrix-vector multiplication can be performed during time iterations. Is this feasible?...</small>
