<small>After a discussion with @milroy, we decided that it does not make sense to modularize the policy and selection algorithm for or slots yet, and that we can save it for when we have more than one policy or decide on how that can be expressed in the job spec. this is a similar point to how we want to deal with or slot counts, we do not yet have a great solution for that yet. ...</small>
