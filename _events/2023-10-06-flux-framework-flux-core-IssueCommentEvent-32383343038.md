<small>Another idea would be to disable to_dict when the JobInfo object doesn't have all required attributes. I guess that is kind of what is happening here, but the error could be improved by catching exceptions inside to_dict and raising a ValueError that says "this JobInfo can't be converted to a dict"...</small>
