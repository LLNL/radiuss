<small>My current theory is the kernel or settings are a bit different for the pipe issue. What base system are you running on @vsoch? Otherwise the spack built stuff wouldn’t have any downstream patches alpine packagers may be using to account for musl compatibility issues. That’s part of why I used alpine packages instead, never know how many things build but don’t actually work at runtime building from source against a new libc....</small>
