<small>After feedback from @milroy and @trws, I reworked the structure of this code. Instead of adding a new resource type, `or_slot` I added a new traverser that changes the way that slots behave. Now, if you load the flexible traverser, `slot` will have the same behavior as `or_slot` as described above. ...</small>
