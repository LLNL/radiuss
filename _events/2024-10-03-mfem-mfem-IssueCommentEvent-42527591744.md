<small>> As a user, I find abstract classes with numerous methods calls to MFEM_ABORT (or similar) very difficult to work with as a user, especially if there is no code that uses those methods. Specifically, it then becomes unclear to me what I actually need to implement if I want to derive from that abstract class (e.g., how many methods of RiemannSolver do I need to implement if I want to define a new approximate Riemann solver for the Euler equations......</small>
