<small>That ppc64el machine reported 4 processors available (nproc), so it would be running oversubscribed.  I was going to comment that I could well believe the problem is exacerbated when the available CPUs are oversubscribed .  I didn't draw attention to it before though, since my own local machine has 8 CPUs and so shouldn't be oversubscribed as such. But sometimes experiences the hang (in that case the problem might be exacerbated from running in pbuilder chroot)....</small>
