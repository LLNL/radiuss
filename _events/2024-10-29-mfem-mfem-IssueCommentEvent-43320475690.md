<small>If you are either using GPUs or using high-order elements, linear form integrators can be sped up quite a bit by implementing "fast assembly" kernels. These aren't currently implemented for the cases you need (we have `VectorFEDomainLFIntegrator`, but for H(div) instead of H(curl), and don't have `VectorFEBoundaryTangentLFIntegrator` currently)....</small>
