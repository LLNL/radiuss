<small>Awhile back @garlic and I had discussions of when jobspec-updates events could occur in the event log.   I donâ€™t remember what we determined, but we deemed #5853 safe to do bc the jobspec is sent along in the journal now.  Hopefully there was no mistake in removing that code.  Will have to look at this again....</small>
