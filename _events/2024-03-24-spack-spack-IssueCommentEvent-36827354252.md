<small>I'm sorry to bother you.I would like to ask how long it will take to complete the update?After building for a while, we found that we couldn't use spack to build semi-automatically.I wonder if you could give me some guidanceã€‚I had a Trilinos installation error while using spack for a semi-automated installation, and I really don't know what to do about it.Hope to get your reply, thank you....</small>
