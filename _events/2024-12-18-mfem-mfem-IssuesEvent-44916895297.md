<p>mkl cpardiso solver when root process does not own any rows</p><small>Context -- I aim to project a matrix coming from an FE discretizations to dofs defined on a surface and then use a direct solver on it (e.g., CPardiso). It happens that the root process may not own any dofs on said surface and so may not own any rows of the projected matrix. This seems to be an issue for CPardiso or perhaps in how mfem interfaces to it....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4634' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
