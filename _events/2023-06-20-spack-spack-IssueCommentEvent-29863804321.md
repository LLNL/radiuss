<small>Yes, currently you need either clang or gcc to link. We'll later use the LLVM linker itself, that should remove all dependencies on clang/gcc, but for now you have to have them. However you can use any gcc or clang, it doesn't have to be the one used to build LFortran. You just need a linker....</small>
