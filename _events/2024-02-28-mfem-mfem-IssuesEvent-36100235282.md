<p>Inconsistent large/nan mass matrix entries</p><small>I have a simple example code (linked below) where I build a mass matrix associated to a finite element discretization of a displacement field. I am getting inconsistent results. That is, without recompiling if I run the same executable with the same command line arguments, e.g., `./ParTest`, I will sometimes see very large (e.g., `3.96423e+214`) entries in the mass matrix and otherwise the entries are of a reasonable order. With mpi, I consistently see issues with the mass matrix, large entries with `mpirun -np 1 ./ParTest -r 0` and even some `-nan` entries with a little bit of mesh refinement `mpirun -np 1 ./ParTest -r 2`. I pulled the most recent mfem and built it this morning. Attached is the code, I am using the `inline-quad.mesh` from `mfem/data`...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4159' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
