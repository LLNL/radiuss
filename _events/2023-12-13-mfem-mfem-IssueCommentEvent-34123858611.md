<small>I second @dylan-copeland's dislike of underscores.  As for `mfem::real` conflicting with `std::real`, I thought the general opinion in the PR meeting today was that the enclosing code would be responsible for disambiguating... is the concern then that this requirement is too onerous because there are many examples that use both `#include<complex>` and `using namespace std;` ?...</small>
