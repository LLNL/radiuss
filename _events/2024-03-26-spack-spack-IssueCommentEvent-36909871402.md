<small>@pranav-sivaraman I added the property with return value True for all the clang compilers present to the best of my ability, so if/when merged, the same should be done for any other clang-based compilers added in the future. I didn't see the clang version of the IBM XL compilers in the configurations, if that's what you're referring to specifically, so yes as far as I know those are not supported yet....</small>
