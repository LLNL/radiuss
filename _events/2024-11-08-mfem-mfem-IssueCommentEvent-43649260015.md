<small>Hi @adam-sim-dev, thank you for testing this branch. Since this is a new feature, it is not surprising that you may find things not supported or working correctly yet with parallel p-refinement. I have listed some things not supported at the top of this PR, and when we find more, they should either be fixed in this PR or documented for a future PR. Please let me know if you are able to identify exactly what is wrong with your application....</small>
