<p>Braid always prints " wall time = 0.00000 " on latest revision</p><small>After pulling from master, I noticed that the latest commits have caused braid to print 0.000 for the global wall time. This happens in serial and parallel. Not sure what is causing it, but I know @jbschroder was working on timing features recently, and this could easily slip past the regression tests, since they can't check for timing....</small><a href='https://github.com/XBraid/xbraid/issues/87' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
