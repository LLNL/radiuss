<small>@zongy17 yes your understanding is essentially correct, although the interface to achieve this might be slightly different depending on the case. See [the user manual](https://hypre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solvers-mgr.html) for a high-level description and [here](https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/blob/b2726f25ee172d671deacf019108df7981b561dd/src/test/ij.c#L5427-L5534) for a more detailed example. See also the [reference manual](https://hypre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch-api.html) for the many options that make the MGR framework quite flexible. Let us know if you have additional questions....</small>
