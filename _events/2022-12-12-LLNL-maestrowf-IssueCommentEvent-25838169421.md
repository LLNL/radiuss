<small>So in that case, what is setting those tags?  Tags can be overwritten silently, which seems ripe for trouble vs keeping it in the toml file directly.  Also, when you build a wheel with something like that what does the name get mangled into for installing?  didn't think pep440 supported the '-<sha>' suffix on wheels.  Is this mainly just the version users would see if they install from source (editable or otherwise)?...</small>
