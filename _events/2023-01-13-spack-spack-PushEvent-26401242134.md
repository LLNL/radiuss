<small>Ninja package: resolve circular dependency (#34887)

#33128 Introduces a dependency on re2c into the Ninja build recipe.
This is problematic on Windows as we use CMake to build re2c, and
Ninja to drive the CMake build. This PR resolves this issue by
adding a variant to toggle the use of re2c with ninja.</small>
