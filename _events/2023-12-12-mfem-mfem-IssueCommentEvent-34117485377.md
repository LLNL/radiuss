<small>Re: alternative `fptype` naming. I would suggest that `real` is the best fit, for a few reasons: 1) including `type` in the name of a type is [hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) and does not add any clarity to the name, 2) The alternative suggestion of `scalar` much more closely relates to matrices and vectors, a scalar is an object that can scale a matrix or a vector: an integer or a complex number could be a scalar, and 3) floating point numbers represent a discretization of a subsection of the real line, so naming it after a member of the real line seems most natural....</small>
