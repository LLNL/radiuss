<small>I believe I have fixed up the remaining whitespace errors, and have updated `constraint_parser()` implementation to use `make_shared` using the suggested code from @trws. Also, now that flux-framework/flux-core#4897 is merged, I added a modicum of end-to-end testing of the more complex RFC 31 job constraints to the testsuite....</small>
