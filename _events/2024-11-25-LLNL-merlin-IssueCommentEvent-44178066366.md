<small>@lucpeterson yeah that's the plan. Once the new tests are merged then all these tests should pass. We'll still need to create tests for the manager itself but I'm going to get started on that hopefully this week. We also need to figure out a good way to integrate the manager command with the existing monitor command, as there's a lot of overlap there....</small>
