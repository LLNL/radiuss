<small>Perhaps you can help me to understand the arguments for this? I'm sorry to keep pushing on this, but I don't see the downsides of further file/class organization by keeping file lengthier shorter and more descriptive. Combining (not directly related) classes into the same header and definition files as done here is also against the style adopted by most of the code in the `fem/` directory....</small>
