<small>UI: Color external packages differently from installed packages (#49751)

Currently, externals show up in `spack find` and `spack spec` install status as a green
`[e]`, which is hard to distinguish from the green [+] used for installed packages.

- [x] Make externals magenta instead, so they stand out.
