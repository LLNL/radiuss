<small>Wouter says is works and is reasonable for him so I'm fine to merge this. It still seems a bit weird to package the two providers together since `qt@:5` was broken up into distinct packages `qt-*`, so `qmake` really will just provide qmake, but not stuff like the Qt GUI. But I guess other packages provide `blas` plus a lot of other functionality, so the analogy holds?...</small>
