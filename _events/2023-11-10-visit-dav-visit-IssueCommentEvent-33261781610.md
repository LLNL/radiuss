<small>I remembered about conduit::blueprint::mesh::coordset::to_explicit() and that let me turn the coordset to explicit before saving, which will get me by for now. Maybe when VisIt sees an unstructured topology with uniform coordsets, the Blueprint reader can call to_explicit() so it plots right but the file can still be smaller....</small>
