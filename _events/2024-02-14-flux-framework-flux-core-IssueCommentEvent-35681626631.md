<small>I think that a submission flag would work as long as the drawbacks that you noted could be overcome. Generally we allow 'standby' jobs to be exempt from other queue limits and allow all users to access them. So, we would also want the preemptible flag could also be seen by the priority plugin so that it can not count those jobs against queue limits. I think that would provide the same benefits as the queue implementation, at least for how we use standby / preemption....</small>
