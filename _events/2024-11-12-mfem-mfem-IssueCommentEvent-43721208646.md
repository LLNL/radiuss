<small>Hi @emorell96 , this is interesting, because `getaddrinfo` is a POSIX function, so [it is supported on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2tcpip/nf-ws2tcpip-getaddrinfo) and should work without problems for ANSI input. Is it that you modified the host name somehow and some wide characters have got to it? Unmodified example 1 otherwise uses just localhost, so I do not understand where the problem would come from ðŸ¤” ...</small>
