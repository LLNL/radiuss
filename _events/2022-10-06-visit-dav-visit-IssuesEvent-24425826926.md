<p>Is quartz1922.cmake still needed</p><small>I happened to be debugging #4802 and was looking at config-site file and noticed that we have two for quartz, `quartz386.cmake` and `quartz1922.cmake`. Ordinarily, I'd expect one to be a symlink to the other but both are unique and the latter hasn't been modified for a year and it was confusing me when I was looking at it....</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/4836' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
