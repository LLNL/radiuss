<small>Hi @trws @rhornung67, in order to get this new SYCL compiler to work, I had to change some namespaces in this Desul file https://github.com/desul/desul/blob/master/atomics/include/desul/atomics/Adapt_SYCL.hpp. It appears that the latest version of that file is correct, but our RAJA version of Desul is out-of-date. Should I update Desul in RAJA to accommodate these changes?...</small>
