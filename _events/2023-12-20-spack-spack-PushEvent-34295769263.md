<small>"spack diff": add ignore option for dependencies (#41711)

* add trim function to `Spec` and `--ignore` option to 'spack diff'

Allows user to compare two specs while ignoring the sub-DAG of a particular dependency, e.g.

spack diff --ignore=mpi --ignore=zlib trilinos/abcdef trilinos/fedcba

to focus on differences closer to the root of the software stack</small>
