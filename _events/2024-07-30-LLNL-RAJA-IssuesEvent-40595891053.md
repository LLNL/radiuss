<p>Combine reduction implementations for new and old interfaces</p><small>Currently we have a copy of the reduction implementation for the new and old interfaces for at least the GPU. We should be able to combine them into a single implementation. I had this in mind when I implemented the multi-reductions so I think we can probably do something similar and then use that to implement the new reduction interface as well....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/issues/1709' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
