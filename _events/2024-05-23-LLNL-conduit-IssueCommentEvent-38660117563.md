<small>Polyhedral topology have a node ordering requirement in Silo that is not required for Blueprint. See the Silo docs for more information. What this means is that Blueprint data that does not conform to that requirement will not render properly in VisIt. So, meshes like `basic` don't look right. Perhaps we could look at some kind of inside-out test and then reorder nodes. We can investigate for the future....</small>
