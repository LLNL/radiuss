<small>In your pendulum.c example (and in my Scilab code),  lambda is initially 0 which is correct considering the initial position (0,1), but when I test with (sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2)), initializing lambda with zero seems fine although the correct value, which is attained at first (very small) step is 6.9367175. Is it OK to initialize multipliers to zero for a DAE of this kind (comming from a Lagrangian of some pointwise masses with constraints) ?...</small>
