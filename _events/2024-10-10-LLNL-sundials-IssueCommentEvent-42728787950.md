<small>I believe that all conversations have now been resolved.  The only remaining item to do in the code is to adjust how the number of RHS evaluations is retrieved by the user (addressed in PR #587).  Whichever of the two PRs is merged second will need to be updated slightly.  I'll request "re-review" by everyone so folks can verify that their concerns have been resolved....</small>
