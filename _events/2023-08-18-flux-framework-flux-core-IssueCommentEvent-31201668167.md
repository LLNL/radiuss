<small>Well crud. I'm going to sleep on it for now, but the manifest command is still giving the same strange error. Maybe I'll have to use the buildx method or something else. All the builds and individual pushes are working fine, but we aren't continually updating the main :bookworm container right now so I'll try to figure it out asap. ...</small>
