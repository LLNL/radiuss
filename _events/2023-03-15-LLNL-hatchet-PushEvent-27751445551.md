<small>Refactors setuptools to fix Cython issues and be consistent with Thicket (#85)

* Updates use of setuptools to comply with PEP 517/518 and be consistent with Thicket

* Adds code to auto-run NPM to build visualization code when 'hatchet.vis' is accessed

* Adds hatchet.vis as a package

* Removes built Cython code (i.e., .c files) from version control

* Makes it so that C files will be generated when creating sdists/wheels, but don't need to be kept in version control</small>
