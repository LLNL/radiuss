<small>Hi @markcmiller86 I am sorry, but I am not sure how to collect these artifacts. I am running VisIt locally on a linux machine through the GUI and connecting to my University's HPC via host profile. Outside of the GUI, I am fairly novice with this program. Thank you for your quick response and patience....</small>
