<small>@tepperly @cnpetra Please feel free to review the changes. It works fine on LLNL CI, pass all the tests with/without CUDA, RAJA, OPENMP, MPI. However, right now it cannot pass PNNL CI due to a narrowing conversion when Ginkgo is used. I have opened a new issue for that, and I will pin @pelesh for further investigation....</small>
