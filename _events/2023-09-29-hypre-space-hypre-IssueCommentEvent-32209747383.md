<small>@victorapm I've setup a small test program which shows the issue. Along with the test program I provide you with matrices for three different mesh sizes (the mesh size is halfed from one mesh to the next). Each mesh has 5 "special basis functions" with large support. If we leave away the special basis by removing the last 5 rows and columns (mesh file ending in `_without`), then the number of CG iterations decreases drastically. ...</small>
