<p>Simple CMakeLists.txt</p><small>Hi! I'm looking to build this with nix, and the way you have the custom install (running the bash script) is not ideal (it largely won't work). Can you share the most vanilla method to get this built with a standard cmake command? Apologies I'm not a heavy cmake user so I don't really know how it works. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/conduit/issues/1041' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
