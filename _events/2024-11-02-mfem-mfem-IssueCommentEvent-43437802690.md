<small>@cjvogl , I added some notes about usage to `FluxFunction` and `RiemannSolver`. That is the maximum I can do, as removing the average-related functions would make this PR nearly useless for the HDG development. I need to chop the beast ðŸ¥© ðŸ˜„ . The functions are not much specific and no worries, the plan is to merge HDG this fiscal year and I am here to oversee it to that end....</small>
