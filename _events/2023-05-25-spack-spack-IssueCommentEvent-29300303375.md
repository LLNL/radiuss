<small>It's not on my horizon at the moment, and likely not on the near horizon, but it's something I'm keeping in the back of my mind for the distant horizon. Long-term, we would love for Spack to only contain compiled Python packages and reach out to PyPI for all pure-Python packages so that someone (me) doesn't have to add/update/review the millions of packages on PyPI. But that requires better metadata from PyPI, so it's out of our control....</small>
