<small>Hi all, I'm also trying to update some dependencies for `numcodecs` for a WebAssembly build of it in zarr-developers/numcodecs#529 and I stumbled across this issue. I am fully cognisant of how concerted an effort is required to officially support NumPy 2.0 based on the previous conversation here; may I ask if it's possible to publish a source distribution for `zfpy` to PyPI in the meantime? It would be beneficial for Pyodide's in-tree recipes (pyodide/pyodide#5169) where I tried to package `zfpy` but there wasn't a source distribution available (https://pypi.org/project/zfpy/#files). We're also planning to release a new version of Pyodide soon which will have all NumPy-dependent packages rebuilt for NumPy v2 (pyodide/pyodide#4925), so we can try out an "unofficial" WASM build with NumPy v2 in the time this issue gets resolved....</small>
