<small>I'm not particularly interested in opempi - [it sucks on Google Cloud](https://github.com/converged-computing/operator-experiments/tree/main/google/bare-metal-comparison/compute-engine/experiments/mpis#results) :laughing: but I would love to see your parsl + Flux example so we can port to the Flux Operator (if you are able/willing to share). We likely would install alongside vanilla flux (sans Spack) so it would be another potentially useful setup!...</small>
