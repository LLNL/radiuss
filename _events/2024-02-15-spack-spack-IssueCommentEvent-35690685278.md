<small>It looks like this issue in mesa was fixed with this mesa PR: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22980 which is part of v23.2 of mesa, so I'll suggest switching to `mesa@23.2.1`. The issue seems to be due to the removal of the missing file in llvm 17 (specifically here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/f7ca01333214f934c580c162afdee933e7430b6c), so probably using an older llvm is another solution....</small>
