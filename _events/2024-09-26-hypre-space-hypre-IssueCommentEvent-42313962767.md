<small>Just to follow up on the performance of ILU as smoother for GMRES AMG generally in both CPU and GPU. I could not find a setting that worked with my problem. Using FSAI smoother converged pretty fast in about 70 iterations. Using ILU it stagnates with convergence rate of 0.99. I would expect ILU should work in similar performance with FSAI if not better. I tried with all ILU types and had no luck. Is there any documents/papers that I can look at for more info of how to improve performance of ILU smoother?...</small>
