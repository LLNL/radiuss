<small>Hi @victorapm , thank you for following this. The answer is no, we did not take the time yet to upgrade the the latest Hypre release and re-activate OpenMP, yet. I am leaving Intel, so I will not be the guy that takes care of this next step. But I  think that this task is scheduled for Q1, 2024. The person that will probably be in charge of this work is [@breytnerjoseph](https://github.com/breytnerjoseph), you may want to follow up with him in some time....</small>
