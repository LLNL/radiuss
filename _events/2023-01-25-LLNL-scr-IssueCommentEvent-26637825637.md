<small>Most projects don't bother to build both static and shared libraries in the same configuration. Some do though. It is really a matter of preference.  What you have is fine. Some people will want static, some will want shared, but most won't care. As long as it's documented that's fine. If you are going to build both, it is nice to have a way to grab the static vs shared library....</small>
