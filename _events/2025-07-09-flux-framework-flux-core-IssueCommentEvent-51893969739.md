<small>I agree that this shouldn't be forwarded through the cache, but it probably should work on the cache.   Then tools such as `flux fsck` could work on the cache if that's ever helpful.  Sort of like running system `fsck` on a block vs a character device.  It's really just a load without payload so no reason not to make it work everywhere....</small>
