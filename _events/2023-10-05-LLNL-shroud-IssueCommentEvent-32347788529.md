<small>I take a look on Shroud source code and it seems that `s_` in the struct name is hard coded, so I was looking for some way of adding a `if` statement while wrapping the struct to check whether the variable type is the same as the struct and add the `s_` to it too. However I do not knowif this would be the best way of implementing it....</small>
