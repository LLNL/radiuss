<small>Navier urans conflict (#4108)

* Adding capability to do partial assembly and full assembly for components of elasticity on GPUs. Added lor_elast miniapp.

* Made buildable for sequential variant.

* remove variable shadowing

* fixing static assert and unused variable

* more warning fixes

* fixing more compiler warnings. Added make test for miniapp

* make ordering part of the doftoquad map

* reverting some changes to bilinear form infrastructure

* reverted changes to operator and blockoperator to simplify pr

* added lexicographic full for the rest of the possible element and derivative configurations

* Improved and expanded the doxygen comments in BilinearForm

* Fixed a reference to the DiagonalPolicy enum.

* Fixed some spacing issues I broke and added doxygen to the remaining methods that didn't have it.

* make style

* applying some suggestions

* Update fem/integ/bilininteg_elasticity_kernels.hpp

applying suggestion to delete @file doxygen line

* got rid of forall macros in kernels

* added GetEVectorOrdering function

* added same tests from makefile to CmakeLists.txt

* implemented the LEXICOGRAPHIC_FULL idea

* removed the overloads for GetDofToQuad. Changed MFEM_VERIFY conditions to reflect adding the new enum value

* reverted the move of ElementDofOrdering

* reverting a random newline that was deleted

* using CoefficientVector

* Added checks to make sure compression types of CoefficientVector were supported. Refactored to remove need for PACalled. Made QuadratureFunction a forward declaration in bilininteg instead of an include.

* astyle

* Update fem/bilinearform.hpp
