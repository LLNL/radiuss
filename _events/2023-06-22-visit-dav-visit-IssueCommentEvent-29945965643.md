<small>I don't know how useful it might be but you might wanna make that an export option (to use absolute or relatvie paths). Reason I mention is that for Dr. Mondy's blood vessel data, the files were so darn large, we didn't want to move the actual data, just the `.visit` files that referenced them. In that case absolute paths were much easier. I could `give` or otherwise move the `.visit` files around and they would all still *work* in the sense that they'd find the one and only copy of the actual raw data files....</small>
