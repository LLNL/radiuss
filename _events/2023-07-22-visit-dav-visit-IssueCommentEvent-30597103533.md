<small>The blank image with the WarpX data is from rendering zonal data with the pseudocolor plot. When I set the centering in the pseudocolor plot attributes to nodal the image appears. This may be the same issue with the color bar not appearing since that is probably rendering rectangles of a constant color....</small>
