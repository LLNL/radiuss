<small>re-opening, although we're supporting backwards compatibility, we would prefer that tests do not output an unnecessary warning message.  So we'd still like to do this change.  It is just no longer "breaking" if we don't do it.  We can merge at our leisure after https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/pull/4776 is merged....</small>
