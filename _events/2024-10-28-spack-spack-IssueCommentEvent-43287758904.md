<small>> @becker33 I am thinking about the case of `spack concretize -f` where I want to clear the concretized specs from the environment, but I don't want to re-read the included concrete. Currently there is no way to do that, you must re-read the included concrete environments or reuse the existing concrete specs in the environment....</small>
