<small>As an exercise, I worked through the permutation logic for a cubic tetrahedron. If I've done everything correctly, the ordering of the dofs within an element is (i, ij1, ij2, j, ik1, ijk, jk1, ik2, jk2, k, il1, 1jl, jl1, ikl, jkl, kl1, il2, jl2, kl2, l) where single indices are the dofs associated with vertices, double indices are dofs associated with edges and the numeral is the number of the dof on that edge (presumably following the edge orientation convention) and triple indices are the dofs associated with triangular faces....</small>
