<small>I'm trying to make a list of all the things that we ought to make sure to test. Some of this is going to be covered by leaving older tests as is, but IMO that's hard to track, so I wanted to make an explicit list here. Feel free to modify, add, and/or subtract (for subtracting, IMO crossing out would be clearer than just removing it)....</small>
