<small>It turns out the `visit-install` script individually lists each llnl host profile to copy. This is a maintenance issue and we should look into having llnl_rz and llnl_cz host profiles and when the user selects just llnl, it copies both sets. The only issue is that some of the host profiles have ssh tunneling set and some don't, so this needs to be investigated if there can be one version with ssh tunneling set (I believe this is the case)....</small>
