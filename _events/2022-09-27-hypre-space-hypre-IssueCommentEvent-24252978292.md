<small>> Okay. Note that we currently don't support a complex version of AMS. The following article discusses an approach based on the equivalent real system: https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/103394/geo2015-0013.1.pdf?sequence=2 . We have plans to support this directly in hypre, but I don't have a definitive time-frame to give you. Tzanio Kolev ( @tzanio ) may have more to add or suggest on this front....</small>
