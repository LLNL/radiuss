<small>Out of curiosity, has anyone run a perf test on the versions before we noticed this to see if we had a regression on lonodex or if it's something that just showed up?  I know the hetchy config and queues are part of it, but if we had low but predictable performance with lonodex before we might not have seen it....</small>
