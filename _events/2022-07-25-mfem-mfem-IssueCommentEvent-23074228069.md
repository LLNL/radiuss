<small>Hi,  thanks a lot.  Actually,  this was my first attempt.  Unfortunately, it fails to run in parallel.  For this,  I add the -pa (partial assembling) in the command line, but, it seems to me I  got memory leak issues.   I will try to give more descriptions on the exact problem as soon as possible...  Properly it is not only the problem with boundary assignment, but something else.  I have tried to run ex5p.cpp with modification to my particular applications.   Thanks...</small>
