<small>Use caliper (#2003)

* initial Caliper support/annotation

refine Caliper annotation for a few alg in layers/loss

Restore support for labels and responses in synthetic data reader

lenet only one epoch; resnet use synthetic input

add profiler_caliper callback; more specific caliper scope marking

push cali scope down into data-type_layer for fp|bp compute, and remove caliper annotation from affected subclasses; add adiak support and setup initial keys

initial adiak_config.hpp.in; example autotune im2col

minor adjustment in how profiler caliper picks up execution context

im2col_2d caliper autotune example

create macros to avoid seeing #ifdef CALIPER guards around all of the annotations; back out fp/bp annotations in lower level data layer - revisit this later when checking symmetry between cpu and gpu runs

remove annotation in cudnn layer; add annotation to other fill routines e.g. gaussian_fill_procdet, fix lenet caliper script when you don't have caliper python package

Adiak v0.2.2 uses adiak:: namespace - setup target_link as apropo; vision/lbann.cali has autotune key for running lenet_caliper_example.py in apply_autotune mode; some cleanup

* Fixed incomplete rebase conficts.

* Fixed missed merge conflict.

* Fixed the proto number.

* Fixed compile error

* Fixed compiler errors with Caliper enabled.

* Mark fp,bp_compute in data_type_layer

This will incur a tiny overhead but simplifies the code significantly.

* Clean up includes

* Cleanup whitespace-only diffs

* Updates to the profiler_caliper callback

* Remove autotuning, as it is out-of-scope of adding caliper annotation to LBANN

* Add caliper to the existing lbann profiling interface

* Remove profiler_caliper callback; just use the regular profiler callback

* Cleanup whitespace-only diffs

* Remove machine-specific cali file

* formatting

* revert changes in im2col header

* Add hip compiler artifacts to adiak config

* Apply suggestions from code review
