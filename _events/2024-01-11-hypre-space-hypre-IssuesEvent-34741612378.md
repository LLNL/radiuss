<p>print vector all the same</p><small>Hey,all! When I use AMS as a preconditioner and solve it with PCG or BiCGstab, I find that the exported solutions are almost the same regardless of the accuracy of the final residual. I import the exported solutions, matrix, and right-hand side into MATLAB to calculate the relative residual, but I cannot achieve the accuracy output by hypre.
