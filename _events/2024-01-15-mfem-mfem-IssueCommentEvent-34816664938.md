<small>> I have no particular attachment to the `ArraysByName<T>::Copy` method (or the copy constructor) but I feel that it is important to provide an interface which is analogous to the `Array` class (and other MFEM classes). I think, therefore, that the decision to remove such methods should extend to the library as a whole but I don't want to make that decision in this PR....</small>
