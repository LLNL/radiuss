<small>> To allow long matches, you could make the limit configurable and/or disable it for instance owner. This might be slightly more work, and would allow large matches to proceed instead of catching them before they are even attempted, but would be more reliable in that it would place a hard limit on the amount of time a match is allowed to take. Just an idea, and perhaps it could even be used in concert with the constraint limits already proposed in this PR....</small>
