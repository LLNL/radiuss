<small>Having all of events would be pretty slick.  Adding config options would also be great but IMO not necessary for a MVP - maybe just a way to toggle each event type's logging on/off?  For my needs from the admin side, speed of implementation beats optimization for now.  (Which I realize is what everyone says...)...</small>
