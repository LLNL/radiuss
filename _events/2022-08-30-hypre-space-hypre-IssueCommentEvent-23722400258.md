<small>Hi @pbauman .  Please give issue #513 a quick read to get my take on this.  The entire software community seems to be rolling over and going with the "easy fix", but I think this sets a bad precedent.  Compiler standards have reserved words, but they should not be reserving file names.  This file is used internally by us.  It is not installed anywhere for others to potentially clash with (so we don't prefix it with `hypre_` for example)....</small>
