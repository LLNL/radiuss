<small>I *believe* that I've addressed all PR comments (modulo some answers I provided to questions that may require further discussion, and modulo changing any "default" behavior as Steven requested).  The automated tests are currently failing because of differences in runtime statistics (some improved, others not).  While I work through those test result differences, I would appreciate it if @gardner48, @balos1, and @Steven-Roberts could look back through this PR to see if their previous requests/questions have been satisfied, and to see if my new changes pass their approval....</small>
