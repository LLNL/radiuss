<small>Enforce consistent GPU targets in spack environment (#2132)

* There is a poor behavior in Spack environments where PyTorch is
concretizing some of its dependents with different GPU architectures
than what LBANN and the rest of the environment are using.  This
forces all packages in the environment to use a common set of GPU
architecture variants.

Also add the Aluminum v1.0.0-lbann as the stable default version.

* Allowed for newer PyTorch versions</small>
