<small>@da-wad I assume we need to fix `setup.py` to make progress.  I can envision several approaches, such as a hot fix (perhaps applied to the `release1.0.1` branch), a new patch or tweak release (I'd prefer not to), or perhaps even pointing zfpy-wheels at a commit on develop.  Do you have a sense of whether this is the only issue stopping us from building wheels?...</small>
