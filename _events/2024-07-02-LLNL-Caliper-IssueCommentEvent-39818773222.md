<small>@andrewreisner I have tried both of them, but neither worked. I even changed the version of Caliper for ver. 2.7.0, 2.8.0 and 2.9.0 but they all reported the same error. I guess there is an internal mechanics of Caliper of how `MPI_Finalize` affect `flush`. Currently I will just remove `MPI_Finalize` calls. Thanks for your help again....</small>
