<small>renaming descriptions of Optimization Problems... the general optimization problem which is more useful for PDE- and bound-constrained optimization is now described just as that GeneralOptProblem... the problem format min E(u) s.t. g(u) >= 0 and where (as the interior-point solver sees) the bound-constrained variable is a slack variable is now the less general but fairly descriptive OptProblem... the QPOptProblem (formerly QPContactProblem) now is more aptly described as there is nothing specific to contact that the class invokes</small>
