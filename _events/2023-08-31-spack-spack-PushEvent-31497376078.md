<small>llvm: fix for Flang variant due to exception handling (#36171)

* The flang project does not support exceptions enabled in the core llvm
library (and developer guidelines explicitly state they should not be
used).  For this reason, when the flang variant is selected,
LLVM_ENABLE_EH needs to be disabled.  In the current main branch of
llvm (and thus future releases), enabling flang and setting
LLVM_ENABLE_EH will cause the overall build to fail.

* Update var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/llvm/package.py
