<small>Thanks for making us aware of this. I agree that in the context of CMake it makes sense to treat cfp as a component of zfp. Have added some hooks for zfp into zfp-config.cmake (see its comments for details) that should properly expose the necessary targets. Let me know if this works for you....</small>
