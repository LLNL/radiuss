<small>Ok, I'd be happy to talk to him about it.  The funny thing about cmake is that what's in here is functionally equivalent to whatever he'd want to do, except it doesn't factor out the scary string matching stuff, so I'm not sure it makes sense to delay much if that's going to be a while.  This isn't a bandaid like the original alias in desul was, it's exposing the cuda target under two names, which I thought would be a good way to support a deprecation cycle across a BLT release....</small>
