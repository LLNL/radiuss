<small>Yes, py-pip, py-setuptools, and py-wheel are also externals in my setup (i.e. installed alongside python in the first spack instance). Hopefully you can reproduce the problem using that setup.Still, the behavior you’re describing isn’t what I would expect based on my diagnosis of the issue, so maybe something else is at play here.On Jun 2, 2023, at 5:02 PM, Peter Scheibel ***@***.***> wrote:﻿...</small>
