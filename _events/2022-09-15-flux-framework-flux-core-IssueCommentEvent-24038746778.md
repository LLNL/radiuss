<small>FWIW `libeventlog` is implementing [this specification](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_18.html) which requires only second level precision.  I think we were assuming that the convenience of parsing a single JSON scalar value rather than a "time object" or whatever was friendlier here, and clearly we didn't anticipate the need for high precision....</small>
