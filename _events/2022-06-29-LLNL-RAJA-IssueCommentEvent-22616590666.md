<small>That sounds great, I intend to be around for that meeting.  The main question I’ll be thinking about when looking at this is how much of this we can fold out so users get this functionality automatically from the existing types when specifying static bounds.  I don’t think we’ll get all of it, so the added types are probably a good idea, but I think some of the duplication might be able to fold out with some judicious use of C++14-extended constexpr....</small>
