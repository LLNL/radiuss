<p>Examples of constrainedoperator with Matrix Free</p><small>We would like to leverage the constrained operator to apply different types of constraints to our system.  For instance, we would like to apply "rotational constraints" on displacements around a local coordinate system.  We would like to leverage the constrained operator to do this in a matrix free fashion....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4062' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
