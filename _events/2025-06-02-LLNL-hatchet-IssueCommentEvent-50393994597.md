<small>Thanks, that helps to circumvent the error, and wasn't quite obvious from the documentation. However, now I have issues seeing all the relevant data in the Hatchet output with my real-life application. Not sure if it is related to the issue reported above. Please let me know if I should create a separate ticket for that....</small>
