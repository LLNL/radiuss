<small>Thanks @JacobLotz for making an example in the miniapp. It is very helpful to have an example of the workflow for using a periodic NURBS mesh. It would be nice if the mesh file specification of the periodic boundary worked, which would simplify this workflow. If you could not get it working, maybe we should keep this in mind and fix it in the future, but I think this PR is a good and complete change. Even if you think the periodic information input from the file isn't working, I suppose we can keep that code for future reference, and hopefully we can fix it in a subsequent PR....</small>
