<small>Update: if I install and load the intel-oneapi-compilers spack package and use spack compiler find to add them in, the r-rcpp spack package installs without error, but I am concerned that using Intel compilers for one package and gcc for the rest will cause problems. Any insight as to why the r-rcpp spack package requires Intel compilers to install?...</small>
