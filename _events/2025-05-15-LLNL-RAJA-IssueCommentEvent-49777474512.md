<small>@bechols97 so one of the libraries I maintain has a failure macro that on the host side throw an error with some useful error messages associated with it which can provide useful context for users / developers for why something failed. Do you think we could emulate something like with this framework if we could provide the absolute max size of the char array / string literal that we'd like and then at the error site have that passed into your message class?...</small>
