<small>I think the change @rppawlo is proposing would need to be made on the Trilinos side, to one of the CMakeLists.txt files within Piro.  @rppawlo please let me know if I am misunderstanding.  The change could be made to the current version of Trilinos develop, but I'm not how to propagate it into a previous release....</small>
