<small>> @mmuetzel Any thoughts on why the msys toolchain is [failing to link](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/actions/runs/9569441560/job/26381984013?pr=506) with shared libraries still? I do not have a system with msys setup to be able to inspect it easily and it seems like you are more familiar with the MSYS/Windows toolchain than myself....</small>
