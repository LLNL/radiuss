<small>> The issue is that newer kokkos requires to build your project with hipcc (poorly documented), nothing to fix upstream and the fix for the spack package should be trivial `CXX=hipcc`. I Will go ahead and fix this in the spack package, I wonder if you could test my PR once it is ready....</small>
