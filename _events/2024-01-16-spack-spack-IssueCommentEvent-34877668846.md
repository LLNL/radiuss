<small>You're right that the step is done in response to that [article](https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/11/playing-with-fire-how-we-executed-a-critical-supply-chain-attack-on-pytorch/) where we need to clean up a bunch of credentials.  Ideally, we should release a new version of torchdata.  But the development there has kind of frozen, so I did that update manually to clean up the mess.  Sorry for causing the trouble and I'll keep that in mind to not force push the existing tags....</small>
