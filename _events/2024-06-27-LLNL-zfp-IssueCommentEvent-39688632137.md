<small>@robertu94 I appreciate the contribution and would like to merge your PR, though we first need to find a workaround for the AppVeyor tests, which use CMAKE 3.16.  I've been wanting to transition off AppVeyor and move to GitHub Actions.  I can't remember what the issues were when we last looked into this, and I'm afraid I don't have time to tackle that at the moment....</small>
