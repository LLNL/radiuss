<small>In addition to RZAnsel, I was able to reproduce this issue on another system (LANL's Darwin cluster, on the POWER9 partition ). This system uses GCC and spectrum-mpi at nearly the same versions as RZAnsel. I'm attaching the `spack-build-env.txt` from both the successful scenario (installing `trilinos` outside of a Spack environment) and the failing scenario (installing `trilinos` within a Spack environment) for you to look at. Perhaps you can see a discrepancy?...</small>
