<small>FYI - a user wants to run 2 jobs on a system, each using 4 cores and 4 gpus, but they are hitting a roadblock due to this issue. If they request two jobs each with 4 cpus and 4 gpus, then they each get different GPUs, but the cores are not necessarily adjacent to the allocated GPUs, and in fact the sets of cores will likely be sequential....</small>
