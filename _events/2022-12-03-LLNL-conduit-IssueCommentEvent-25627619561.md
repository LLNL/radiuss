<small>The coordinated parallel I/O is handy for blueprint meshes, but I have a restart file with data that doesn't match the blueprint mesh format. I'm currently communicating each rank's group to rank 0 (using relay MPI) and using rank 0 to write each group to an hdf5 file as it is received. I feel like that's a very common use case and would simplify application code....</small>
