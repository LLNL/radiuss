<small>Windows CI: add paraview deps nightly build (#37924)

Add a nightly job to attempt building all Paraview dependencies and
upload the results to cdash. This check doesn't affect the reported
build/test status of Spack. We are using this to monitor the state of
Windows support while working on more-robust checks (eventually the
Windows build will have to succeed to merge PRs to Spack).</small>
