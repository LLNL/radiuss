<p>The predicted maximum compressed capacity is much larger than the actual</p><small>When I try to use the tolerance mode to compress the original 47M data, I set the tolerance to 0.001, but the predicted maximum compressed capacity is 49M, which is larger than my original data, and the actual space used after compression At around 9M, I guess itâ€™s because my data is not evenly distributed, a large amount of data is around 0.01, but some data is greater than 1, and if I use the precision mode, the error of some data will be too large. How can I choose the mode and set the parameters? When the prediction is guaranteed to be similar to the actual situation, the accuracy is still guaranteed....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/zfp/issues/200' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
