<small>OTOH, if the meshes evolve so much differently that there does not exist a common base mesh that sufficiently overlaps the meshes at all the relevant timestates, then, yes, I think a databinning (obviously of appropriate bin count/resolution for relevant dimensions) which produces a result back on to the "original mesh" (you'd have to pick which timestate you'd want that to be), might be best alternative....</small>
