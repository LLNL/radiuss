<small>New (partial) pipeline is here: https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/pipelines/669400607. Looks like it is clean, thank you for the hot fix. You probably want to decorrelate the fix for Intel compilers from the one for the wrongful use of `make` instead of `$(MAKE)`. Hopefully, the latter will be easy to integrate (just two different SLOC). For Intel compilers, we have about 6 months ahead of us for the next PETSc release, so I'm not in a hurry. Thanks....</small>
