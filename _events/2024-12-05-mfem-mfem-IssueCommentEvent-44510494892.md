<small>There are two families of Nedelec elements on tets. What I described above is the first kind which is implemented in MFEM. The second kind uses the space $\left(P_k\right)^3$ and this second kind is not implemented in MFEM. Monk's book describes both kinds I think, so maybe you are looking at the definition of the second kind....</small>
