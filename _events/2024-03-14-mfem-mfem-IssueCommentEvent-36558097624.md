<small>I don't think it makes sense for `QuadratureSpace` to have a `vdim`. It's common to need many different `vdim` quantities at the same quadrature points. For example, you might have matrices, vectors, and scalars all living at the same quadrature points â€” it's convenient for all of these to share the same `QuadratureSpace`. The main purpose for `QuadratureSpace` is to associate to every element in the mesh a quadrature rule. The `vdim` of the fields is orthogonal to this concept....</small>
