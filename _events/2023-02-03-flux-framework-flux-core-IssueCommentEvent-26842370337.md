<small>> Another only slightly related idea was to have job-list support RFC 31 style constraint objects. This is what I'm using in the full flux pgrep implementation, and theres a nice query syntax (RFC 35) for it. For now flux pgrep just pulls down max_entries jobs and filters locally, but perhaps there is a way to turn an RFC 31 Constraint object into a SQL query......</small>
