<small>WarpX: Python on pyAMReX (#45251)

* WarpX: Python on pyAMReX

Long overdue update for WarpX: in 2024, we updated our Python
bindings to rely on the new pyAMReX package. This deprecates the old
`py-warpx` package and adds a new dependency and variant to WarpX.

Also deprecates old versions that we will not continue to support.

* Update Cloud/E4S Pipelines for WarpX

`py-warpx` is replaced by `warpx +python`
oneAPI does not support IPO/LTO: diable for `py-amrex` even though
pybind11 strongly encourages it.</small>
