<small>It's mainly a preference thing, if someone wants to say use the remote extension to develop on one of the clusters, which is already set up as a dev environment, then it will use the local setup and you can install or not install the plugins you want.  Also potentially good for using debugging features, since it's likely we'll end up needing to debug outside of the devcontainer at least sometimes....</small>
