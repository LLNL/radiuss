<p>Computing the static magnetic field energy</p><small>I have compute the static magnetic field of a microstrip and I want to compute the static magnetic field energy. To do so I have to compute the integral of the square of the field over the entire domain. I wrote the code below, but I am not sure about the weights, there is a weight from the integration rule and another weight from the element transformation. Should they both be applied?...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4166' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
