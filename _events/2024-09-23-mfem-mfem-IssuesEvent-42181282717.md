<p>Possibly missing dependency for STRUMPACK support (macOS)</p><small>I have been trying to get MFEM's integrated STRUMPACK solver to run for a few days and it somehow took a lot more effort than I as hoping for. To begin with, it is entirely possible that my problems were due to my systems configuration or my ignorance towards certain config files in the MFEM repository. I still thought I'll bring it up here such that either people with similar problems can find it and/or one can adapt the build system accordingly. Or perhaps there is even a smoother way to resolve this....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4517' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
