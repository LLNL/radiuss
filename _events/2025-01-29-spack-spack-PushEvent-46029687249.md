<small>package api: drop wildcard re-export (#48760)

* package api: drop wildcard re-export

To ensure package repos are forward/backward compatibility with Spack,
we should explicitly export all symbols we want to expose in the public
package API, and drop `from spack.something import *` because
removal/addition to the public API will go unnoticed.

Also `llnl.util.filesystem` has some methods that shouldn't be exposed
in the package API, so better to enumerate a subset explicitly.

* remove flatten_dependencies / install_dependency_symlinks</small>
