<small>Another point to consider, the internal implementations of things in RAJA, like reductions, are very complex for GPU back-ends in particular. They have been highly tuned based on compiler, back-end programming model, memory usage, and other issues. It would not be wise to try to develop and maintain Axom versions of such things, IMO....</small>
