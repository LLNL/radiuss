<small>Would love that! We have an early PR here: https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/pull/4576 where I got most of it working with setuptools, and that could install from pip via the .tar.gz produced! I'm actually not super familiar with hatch but I'd love to see how it works here! ...</small>
