<small>Yes, I guess my frustration is not that this wasn't approved, but that there were no suggestions for how to make it work or hints as to what I might be doing wrong. #34302 suggests that this should work, but in practice it doesn't seem to work and I don't know why. If anyone has any ideas, I'm willing to play around, but there haven't been any suggestions since November so I just gave up....</small>
