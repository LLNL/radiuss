<small>Set the default to scipy 1.8 until we can resolve the meson issues. That should get CI to pass. We _could_ keep the default as 1.9 but change CI to build older scipy, but that would be more work that would have to be undone later. Hoping this can be merged now and we can fix the meson issues in a new meson release....</small>
