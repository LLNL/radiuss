<small>In a little greater detail, I propose to allow the user to specify offset, stride, and size as length-n arrays.  The code that prepares to call `H5Sselect_hyperslab()` would properly use these arrays instead of hardcoding length-1 arrays.  The challenge is how to do this without allocation....</small>
