<small>The real goal is to address a memory leak caused by calling `HYPRE_AMSSetup` on the same solver multiple times. I've proposed an implementation that fixes the memory leak (https://github.com/mfem/mfem/pull/3096), but if I could read the solver's settings/properties I'd be able to reset the solver to whatever it was before, instead of resorting to some default set of settings....</small>
