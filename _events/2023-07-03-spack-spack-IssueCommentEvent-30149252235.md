<small>@KiruyaMomochi apologies for taking over your PR. I'm going to start hacking on this and get it to a mergeable state. Trying to wrap my head around all of the stuff @tgamblin and I wrote originally for bash, it's been so long that I barely remember why we designed things this way. I may ask you for help with fish-specific stuff at some point....</small>
