<small>At the moment this is mostly needed for flux-coral2 testing, because in actual usage jobspecs like mentioned above are constructed after submission and only the job-manager's copy (which it sends to the scheduler) is modified. However, as @grondo mentioned on a call, the copy the shell receives will still be the user's original, signed version. So I think this issue shouldn't be seen in production, under the current design of flux-coral2....</small>
