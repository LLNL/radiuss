<small>refactor: add type annotations and refactor solver conditions (#42081)

Refactoring `SpackSolverSetup` is a bit easier with type annotations, so I started
adding some. This adds annotations for the (many) instance variables on
`SpackSolverSetup` as well as a few other places.

This also refactors `condition()` to reduce redundancy and to allow
`_get_condition_id()` to be called independently of the larger condition
function.
