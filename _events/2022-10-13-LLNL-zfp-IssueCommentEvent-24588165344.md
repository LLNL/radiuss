<small>@tpwrules commit [fc96c91](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp/commit/fc96c9158e8befc227f9f46093f5e1b35723be02) merges in changes that should address this. The BUILD_TESTING option still exists and when enabled will build a subset of the tests. These tests should be sufficient for ensuring correctness. However, we will no longer prune the full test suite from releases and now provide a BUILD_TESTING_FULL option for running it if desired. Hopefully this should provide you with the desired functionality....</small>
