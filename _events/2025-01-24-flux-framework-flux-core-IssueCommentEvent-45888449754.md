<small>I think this may be a bug. Shell log errors are _supposed_  to go to the output eventlog as `log` events. However, there may be an issue during early shell initialization where the log messages are lost, perhaps only during fatal errors where the shell exits before things are fully initialized. I thought there was an issue open on this but I can't find it....</small>
