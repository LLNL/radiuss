<small>Hi @jdoerfert @trws, I'm trying to figure out where exactly in RAJA this is tripping up. Is there a way to ask clang/llvm for detailed instruction selection output? I've seen very old versions of clang use this set of option `-mllvm -debug-pass=isel`, but cannot find the modern equivalent of that....</small>
