<small>intel-oneapi-compiler: Fix generation of config files (#43654)

Commit 330a9a7c9ac82e91f18a6cbcd9c067eeaa26d617 aimed at preventing
generation of .cfg files when a given compiler does not exist
in the particular release. However the check does not
contain the full paths so it always fails resulting in empty
.cfg files. This commit fixes it.</small>
