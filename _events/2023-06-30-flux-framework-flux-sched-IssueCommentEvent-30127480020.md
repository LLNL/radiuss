<small>A guess is that `fluxion-resource` is making resources available again once their allocation's time limit has been reached, rather than waiting for them to be explicitly freed.  Since the epilog in this case runs after the job has exceeded its time limit but before resources are freed, we have sad trombones. :sob: :trumpet:  :bone:...</small>
