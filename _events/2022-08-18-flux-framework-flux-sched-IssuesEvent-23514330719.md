<p>CI: add test run of flux-coral2</p><small>Some changes to flux-sched break things over in flux-coral2, see e.g. https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-coral2/pull/23 . Would be nice if there was a way to be alerted that this was going to happen by running the flux-coral2 testsuite on every flux-sched PR....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/961' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
