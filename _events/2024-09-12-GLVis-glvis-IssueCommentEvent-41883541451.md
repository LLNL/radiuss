<small>Ok, this is a more elegant solution and also works for Windows or Linux users who do not know the difference between left and right Alt 😁 . It stores the physical key from `keyDown` as a backup, so if translation of the key gives some weird symbol on Mac or accidentally use the wrong Alt on Windows or Linux with some localized layout 😏 , it returns to handling of that one in `textInput`event (like if it was in `keyDown`) 😉 ....</small>
