<small>In our discussion today, we talked about a couple of different ways log scaling may come into play. One is in the *coordinate* axes. And, I just noticed in Visit that we support this in **View** controls on curves and 2D plots but not 3D plots. That seems a bit odd to me. It might be rare that users deal with 3D geometry in which one of the geometric dimensions is orders of magnitude larger than another but I do occasionally see long, skinny 3D stuff and we do occasionally encounter data we have difficulty handling because its really, really big, or really, really small. Being able to log scale the coordinates in 3D views kinda sorta makes sense to me....</small>
