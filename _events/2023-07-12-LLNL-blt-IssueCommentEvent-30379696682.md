<small>I created a new file `BLTInstallableMacros` that is included by `BLTPrivateMacros` and transitively included by `BLTMacros`.  This new file is a smaller set of macros that only includes the macros necessary for creating targets for third-party libraries in downstream projects.  Please let me know what you think about this....</small>
