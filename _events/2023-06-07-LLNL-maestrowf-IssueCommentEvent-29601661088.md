<small>@bgunnar5  -- Thanks for the contribution! I'll review it this week and get back to you. For now, the changes at a glance seem reasonable, I'd just like to test how this behaves locally. Also, it looks like the doc building step in the testing failed so that needs to pass before we can merge this in....</small>
