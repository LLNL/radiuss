<small>iperf3: updated versions from 3.6 to 3.16 (#44152)

* Update version of iperf3 from 3.6 to 3.16

Spack currently only explicitly has version 3.6 of the iPerf3 package
(out of ESnet / LBNL). This makes the default the latest version of 3.16,
and adds some other versions (found in some Linux distros, for possible
compatibility purposes).

* iperf3: update to 3.17; update 3.6 hash for new url

* protobuf: update hash for patch needed when="@3.4:3.21"

* Revert "protobuf: update hash for patch needed when="@3.4:3.21""

This reverts commit 4d168d0b278039ac2b3c084b7df4c2ae7deb9d27.</small>
