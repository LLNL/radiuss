<small>@jandrej , I will have a closer look later 🧐 , but a general question - what is it good for? 😅 You want to have some way how to stop the solver not only based on the norm of the residual? It looks to me a bit hacky way to use `IterativeSolverMonitor` for it 🤔 . As the name says, it is a monitor, so it is supposed to track the progress (and print it, log it, or so), but I would not expect it to interfere with the process......</small>
