<small>Sorry, I dropped this for a bit. I hear you on the full constraints object being potentially very unwieldy. That said, even something to indicate that there are extra constraints would be helpful. E.g. something that just said `constraints:nodelist` or `constraints:property` in the `info` field to help point users or support staff in the right direction with the all too common "why isn't my job running?" question....</small>
