<small>One useful note I got going today with the help of @cmoussa1 is....since we can get through `autogen.sh` and `./configure` cobbling together tools from homebrew + friends, it's possible to install the manpages on a macbook by navigating to `flux-core/doc` and running `sudo make install` in that subdirectory. Maybe this was obvious to everyone, but it just occurred to me....</small>
