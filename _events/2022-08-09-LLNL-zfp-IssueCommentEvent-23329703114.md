<small>GNU make builds are unfortunately very limited in this respect.  The main use case for such builds is the ability to just type `make` and quickly obtain a static C library (`lib/libzfp.a`) and executable (`bin/zfp`) without the additional steps needed by CMake.  Furthermore, GNU make does not support zfp components such as CUDA/HIP execution, Python bindings, and the 4300+ tests available on the `develop` branch--you need CMake for this....</small>
