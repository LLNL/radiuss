<p>Suggestion: Add a way to show version numbers of modules loaded in flux</p><small>`flux version` can tell me the versions of commands/libflux-core/libflux-security, and `flux module list` combined with `rpm -q` can mostly determine what's what, but it would be nice to have a way to get that info from flux's perspective.  `rpm -q` tells me what's installed, but not necessarily what's *running* at a given time.  I'm thinking about situations like the jgf changes in flux-coral2 v0.17.0 as we move forward and wanting and easy way to trap version info for diagnostics....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/6348' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
