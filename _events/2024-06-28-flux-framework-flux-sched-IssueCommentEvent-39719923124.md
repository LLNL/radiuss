<small>@milroy - Is this branch ready for any testing? I've got @garlick's houskeeping PR (flux-framework/flux-core#5818) installed on a test cluster, but with sched-simple for now since it supports partial release. If it would be helpful I could start testing with this branch instead. Our hope it to include housekeeping as an experimental feature in the next release, currently scheduled for July 2....</small>
