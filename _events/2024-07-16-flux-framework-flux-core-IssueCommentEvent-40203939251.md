<small>Thanks for the advice here. After some time playing around with this I think I was able to get somewhere. I've opened a PR over in flux-framework/flux-accounting#469 that proposes adding some work during plugin initialization where it tries to at least estimate the cores-per-node on the system it's loaded on by fetching `resource.R`. This could be a start to actually keeping track/estimating of a jobs' resources later on. Let me know what you think....</small>
