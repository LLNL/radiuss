<small>> Ah, that is potentially troublesome. Good to catch whatever it is though. I assume that tightening up the linear solver tolerances did not improve things? An alternative might be hitting it with a direct, as that would at least convince that it is something within the basis or the mesh. If it's the wedge basis functions, I'm not sure I would know where to start in debugging those....</small>
