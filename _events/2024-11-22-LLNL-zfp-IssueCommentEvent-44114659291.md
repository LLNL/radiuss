<small>I expect such a post release to be an exception to the norm, so I'm fine with bumping `ZFP_VERSION_TWEAK` to 1 and doing a post release of zfpy, which in this case synchronizes versions.  But if additional minor changes are needed for NumPy 2.0, we'd have to do another post release.  From what I can tell, few if any changes are needed, so should we not try to knock that out now and do only one post release?...</small>
