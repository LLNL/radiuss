<small>OK, I have the DG advection term sorted out. Now if velocity is in Raviart-Thomas HDiv space instead, I need to make another nonlinear integrator? I.e. there's no existing integrator that would fit the bill? In that case, I could modify `VectorConvectionNLFIntegrator` to make it work with HDiv elements?...</small>
