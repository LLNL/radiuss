<small>The example case there is very mild so I wouldn't expect it to fail there, but it would likely start having some issues with more difficult problems. Up to you if you want to leave it in (but maybe add a comment in the example mentioning something like it's not really meant for the Euler equations in its current form). My only worry is that people might take the example case to indicate that it's a Godunov-type Riemann solver for the Euler equations without knowing and use it in their codes which might cause them issues.  ...</small>
