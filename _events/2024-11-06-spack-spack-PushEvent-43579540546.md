<small>`llnl.util.filesystem.find`: multiple entrypoints (#47436)

You can now provide multiple roots to a single `find()` call and all of
them will be searched. The roots can overlap (e.g. can be parents of one
another).

This also adds a library function for taking a set of regular expression
patterns and creating a single OR expression (and that library function
is used in `find` to improve its performance).</small>
