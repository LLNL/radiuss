<small>As openssl is needed for clingo, bootstrapping is broken for now on MacOS. Seems to be a problem within openssl and strict compilation flags (-Werror) together with the current Apple clang version. As user I was not able to tell the bootstrapper to use a different version. Only solution for me was to change to v0.18 for bootstrapping and to change back afterwards....</small>
