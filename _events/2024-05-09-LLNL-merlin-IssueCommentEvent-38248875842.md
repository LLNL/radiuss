<small>@lucpeterson I think the python 3.7 test is throwing warnings since it has an older version of kombu/celery. I think it's time we drop support for 3.7 considering it's already reached EOL. I know 3.8 reaches EOL this year as well but we should probably maintain support for it so long as LC keeps it on systems....</small>
