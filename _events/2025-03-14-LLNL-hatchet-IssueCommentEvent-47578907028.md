<small>@slabasan I'm removing this from the upcoming release. The enhancements added by this PR complicate the process of building queries from the string dialect because I need to know whether or not the DataFrame has a multi-index. Given the other work I have to do, trying to get this done in time for the release is likely not feasible....</small>
