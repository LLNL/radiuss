<small>@IdoAkkerman Thanks for reviewing. This PR is a work-in-progress, still in the early stages, but it is good to get feedback already and to inform other NURBS developers about the significant changes to come. I plan to document better and finish implementation for more complicated cases in 2D and 3D, but it will likely take a while to complete this PR. There will be much more code to come, and I will address your comments along the way....</small>
