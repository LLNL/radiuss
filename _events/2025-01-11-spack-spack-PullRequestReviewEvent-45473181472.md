<small>Awesome, thanks for that! It's always been a bit unclear for me which ROCm/CUDA components are considered part of the stack: we also use `rocrand`, for example, but you didn't see any build errors from that. In newer versions (>= 6 I think) ROCm distributes CMake install files for ROC thrust, but that wasn't the case before....</small>
