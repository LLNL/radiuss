<small>The approach seems sane to me, in fact I can't imagine doing it any better given the constraints we are dealing with.  The help output makes it pretty clear how these should be used.  Hopefully error messages are similarly clear (I didn't look) since I imagine people hacking on batch scripts do a fair bit of cutting and pasting without reading documentation....</small>
