<small>That does seem to work based on my testing. I'm fine with doing that for the sake of having it work, but I do think it would be a lot clearer if the extra stuff at the end were there 🤷🏻‍♀️. Since it's a spack bug though, I guess we could always change the name once they fix the bug. I've updated the spec, as well as the compiler def in the radiuss spack configs repo. ...</small>
