<small>Hi @lucasbanting .  No progress on this, and no real plans in place either.  HYPRE does allow both complex and real types at the same time.  The original idea here was to implement a complex AMS solver that automatically creates the equivalent real system and builds on the real AMS algorithm as described in the article mentioned above....</small>
