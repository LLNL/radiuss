<small>The example spio_IO_SCR_Checkpoint_ex example has unit test code added into it, in order to keep all SCR testing in one executable, as errors occur if two SCR-enabled executables get launched in parallel during a `make test` run.  I think this satisfies the request in this issue.  Any further SCR-based unit testing should be inserted into this example....</small>
