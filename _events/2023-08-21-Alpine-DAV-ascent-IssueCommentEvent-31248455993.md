<small>Moving callback registration/execution into the main interface as static methods does significantly simplify the PR, but I had trouble exposing `execute_callback` in Jupyter afterwards. I didn't bother committing that attempt, but feel free to give it a go yourself. Assuming that the Jupyter piece gets resolved, I think the rework should be a positive change....</small>
