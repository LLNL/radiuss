<small>Most likely obvious, but since I didn't immediately think of it:   the mechanism to add a constraint based on the selected queue would also have to be implemented in such a stopgap.  The algorithm used in the `jobspec-default` jobtap plugin doesn't quite work for this off the shelf as noted in #4438.  I was thinking of possibly adding another plugin to deal with queue constraints as a special case....</small>
