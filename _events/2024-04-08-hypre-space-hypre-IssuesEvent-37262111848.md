<p>Best configuration to BoomerAMG on CPUs</p><small>I am researching about simulations on petroleum reservoirs and I using Galerkin FE method, that results in linear systems. I am trying to use Hypre to solve the resulting linear systems, thats coming from unstructured meshes. The PDE system have nonlinear elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic equations. I am looking for documents and papers about the suitable choices of parameters to BoomerAMG on CPUs, as linear solver or preconditioner. ...</small><a href='https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/issues/1090' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
