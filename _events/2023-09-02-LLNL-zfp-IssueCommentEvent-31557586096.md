<small>I don't know all the issues involved, though I'd be willing to cut a 1.0.1 release if that fixes the problem.  It's however unclear to me what changes to zfp would be needed.  Is it just a matter of bumping the version, or do we also need to make changes to the zfpy build scripts?  Are there any interactions with #210 that we need to consider?...</small>
