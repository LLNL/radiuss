<small>> @v-dobrev, have we looked into supporting dynamic shared memory with `mfem::forall` kernels? Maybe we could add an optional parameter to the `mfem::forall` functions (defaulting to zero) with the size of the dynamic shared memory. We would have to think about how to support this on CPU backends....</small>
