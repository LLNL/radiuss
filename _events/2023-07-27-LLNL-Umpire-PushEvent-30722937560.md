<small>Make allocate API threadsafe when needed (#837)


* The ThreadSafeAllocator strategy was only placing a mutex around the allocate and deallocate calls and tracking and zero-byte-allocation calls were left unprotected since they were being performed out of scope from the ThreadSafeAllocator strategy. The fix was to move the mutex usage up to the Allocator API level where the zero-byte-allocation, tracking, and allocate/deallocate calls were being made.

* Update version number to include both major and minor version information
