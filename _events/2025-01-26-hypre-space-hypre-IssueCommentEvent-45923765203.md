<small>Thanks for the quick reply.  Unfortunately, Hypre code is tested on a slightly larger code on a Windows platform with several different solvers for benchmark/evaluation purposes...for now. I plan to investigate different MPI/OpenMP (Intel, MS, etc) to investigate/confirm the behavior further. If confirmed, I will try duplicating the behavior using Ex5 (the only example with the IJ interface)....</small>
