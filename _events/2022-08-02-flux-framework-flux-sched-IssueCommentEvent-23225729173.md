<small>That's definitely a problem, and probably means a refactor is in order.  I see the conversation on slack from a bit ago, if matchers are cheap to create then doing that sounds good for now.  If not, in the end it really should be a property of a single resource node in the jobspec, so it might be worth the pain to get it there from where it is....</small>
