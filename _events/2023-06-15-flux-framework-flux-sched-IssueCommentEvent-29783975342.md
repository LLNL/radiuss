<small>@stefangary can you look in your spack install directory and the environment variable for `PYTHONPATH` and show us what you see? I'm wondering if it's there somehow (installed by spack) but it's not properly being added to the python path. If you are starting a flux instance it would also be useful to see the paths before / after, since flux also does some changing....</small>
