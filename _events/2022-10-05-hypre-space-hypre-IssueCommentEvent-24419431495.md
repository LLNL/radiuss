<small>The easiest way to get this working is to use a compiler script for MPI (e.g., 'mpicc' or whatever it is for mvapich in your case).  Just make sure its location is in your path so `configure` will find it.  Alternatively, you can set the location of the MPI include and library files with configure options.  Hope this helps!...</small>
