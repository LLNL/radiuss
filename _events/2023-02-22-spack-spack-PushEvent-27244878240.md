<small>Allow users to specify root env dir (#32836)

* Allow users to specify root env dir

Environments managed by spack have some advantages over anonymous Environments
but they are tucked away inside spack's directory tree. This PR gives
users the ability to specify where the environments should live.

See #32823

This is also taken as an opportunity to ensure that all references are to "managed environments",
rather than "named environments". Prior to this PR some references to the latter persisted.
