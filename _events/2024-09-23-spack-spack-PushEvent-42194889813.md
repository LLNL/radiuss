<small>new package: msr-safe (#46289)

This includes a test_linux699 variant which "activates" a version
that pulls from a repository other than the official repository.
This version is required to work with Linux kernel version
6.9.9 or later. Future official `msr-safe` versions are expected
to support later Linux kernel versions.</small>
