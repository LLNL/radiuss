<p>CUDA atomics don't use specialized methods for other 64-bit integral types</p><small>On Linux 64-bit systems, `uint64_t` is typedef-ed to `unsigned long`, which is not implicitly convertible to the `unsigned long long` type used in the CUDA atomic function specializations, despite both being 64-bit unsigned integer types. As a result, calling `RAJA::atomicAdd/Sub/etc.` on a `size_t` or `uint64_t` value results in a fallback to the slower compare-and-swap idiom....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/issues/1326' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
