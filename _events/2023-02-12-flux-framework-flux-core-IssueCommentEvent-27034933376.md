<small>sounds like a plan.  Maybe we should have a PR for something like this open all of the time (or often).  For when we find stupid typos and stuff and the fix doesn't really belong in any other PR?  Normally I tack these onto some PR but I wasn't in the middle of one so didn't have anywhere to put it :P...</small>
