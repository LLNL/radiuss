<small>@omsai the machine I was using to make the error borked after an update and is in a Fedex box back to the lab for fixing so I don't think I can reproduce - I tried on my other machines and the install works as expected! So - either we can just leave it open to see if someone else can reproduce, or we can just close and trust they can open a new issue....</small>
