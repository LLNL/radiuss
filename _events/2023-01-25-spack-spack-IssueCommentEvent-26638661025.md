<small>@tldahlgren LGTM too, so I have no objections for merging it. But I would appreciate if Spack developers would take a look at https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/34011. After merging this I will port the changes into my branch there. I've been keeping it up-to-date in the past months, resolving conflicts, etc. But nothing has happened in terms of review for quite some time....</small>
