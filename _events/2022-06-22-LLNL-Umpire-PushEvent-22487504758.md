<small>Replace umpire::replay with umpire::event (#630)

This update replaces umpire::replay with a new and improved umpire::event mechanism.

The umpire::event mechanism can record events to JSON files (the default) or SQLITE (enabled with `+sqlite` spack variant).

During development, other updates were added including:

1. Update nlohmann/json to 3.10.4
2. Benchmark scripts were added to compare cost of millions of allocations between branches
3. Allocate and makeAllocate events were changed to record only one event after successful allocation/creation instead of two events for before and after attempt to perform request
