<small>@markcmiller86 Can we close this issue or are there other things you'd like to see addressed?  Regarding GNU make installation, I've filed a separate issue, #172.  The subject line of this issue refers to CFP API changes, which I believe can be dealt with using zfp's `VERSION` macros, as outlined above....</small>
