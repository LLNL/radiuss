<small>@subhasis-shell Thanks for this contribution.  We've been working on a complete overhaul of the CUDA backend on the `staging` branch, so it will be difficult to pick up this PR on the `develop` branch at this point.  Just skimming the changes, they don't look all that substantial, but we can't really merge this PR as is without introducing significant conflicts with our changes on the `staging` branch....</small>
