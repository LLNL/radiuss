<small>Yes, in some cases there is an issue with the VTK actor dropping off to lala land.  I have been able to reproduce it but only with certain data sets. Others it works. Quite odd. @brugger1  and I discussed adding a ticket for this issue as IIRC we saw it with the old rendering too. I did not add a ticket because we wanted the dust to settle on the merge/updates etc (in the hopes it would not be an issue further)....</small>
