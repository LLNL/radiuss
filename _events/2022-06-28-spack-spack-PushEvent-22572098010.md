<small>Feature: use git branches/tags as versions (#31200)

Building on #24639, this allows versions to be prefixed by `git.`. If a version begins `git.`, it is treated as a git ref, and handled as git commits are starting in the referenced PR.

An exception is made for versions that are `git.develop`, `git.main`, `git.master`, `git.head`, or `git.trunk`. Those are assumed to be greater than all other versions, as those prefixed strings are in other contexts.</small>
