<small>[WRF] Always use compiler wrappers for FFLAGS/FCFLAGS (#38470)

`FFLAGS` and `FCFLAGS` are being ignored by WRF build system. Not only in version
`3.9.1.1`, but also `4.x`.

Also, I see no reason to explicitly add `-w` and `-O2` to compile lines when
using `gcc@10:`. Tested for version `3.9.1.1`, `4.2.2`, & `4.5.0`.

Tagging original authors of this part @MichaelLaufer and @giordano in case they
want to chime in.</small>
