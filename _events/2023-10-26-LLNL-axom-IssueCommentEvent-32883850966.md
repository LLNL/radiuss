<small>I have been unable to reproduce the crash with the Umpire error message "Cannot find allocator for pointer: ."  In the meantime, several fixes (in particular, those upstreamed to us in #1204 ) went in to the copy of Axom.  I propose to close this bug, to be reopened if the problem reappears....</small>
