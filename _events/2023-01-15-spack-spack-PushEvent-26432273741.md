<small>spack list: add `--count` option (#34950)

Sometimes I just want to know how many packages of a certain type there are.

- [x] add `--count` option to `spack list` that output the number of packages that
      *would* be listed.

```console
> spack list --count
6864
> spack list --count py-
2040
> spack list --count r-
1162
```</small>
