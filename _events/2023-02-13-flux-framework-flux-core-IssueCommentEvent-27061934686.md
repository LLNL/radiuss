<small>Note: [RFC 36](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_36.html) has been merged and describes the specification for solving this issue. There is still time to adopt feedback into the initial RFC before the implementation is posted in a PR (probably by the end of this week)...</small>
