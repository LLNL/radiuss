<small>> You misunderstand, it's not the hardware that's the problem. LLVM itself will fail to compile due to missing symbols in kernel headers on some systems because of selected backends, arm backends in particular. That said, this does seem to have passed the build on gitlab so maybe that issue has been resolved somewhere along the way. What do you think @haampie?...</small>
