<small>`spack test run chapel` is giving me trouble when using `+cuda` and the `CudaPackage` build system class. It seems like `nvcc` isn't being made available during the test ran with `spack test run chapel`. If I manually load `chapel+cuda` or just `cuda` before the test, it works, but just running the test fails. Using `which` to find `nvcc` during the test indicates `nvcc` isn't available....</small>
