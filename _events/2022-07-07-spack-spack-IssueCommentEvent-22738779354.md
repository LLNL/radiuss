<small>@adamjstewart I *think* (but I could be wrong) that `Tensorflow` uses a non-CMake build system and instead generates a soft-link to the `protobuf` include directory (see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/31020#issuecomment-874508912). This link step is what I think is failing here....</small>
