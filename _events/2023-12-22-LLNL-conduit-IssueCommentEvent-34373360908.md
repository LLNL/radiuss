<small>I can possibly see allowing NULL to act as a placeholder for data that is not created yet. Still, it makes a Blueprint tree that is not valid and cannot be used with relay, partitioning, or other algorithms that do not expect to get NULL data in field values. It's easier just to not allow in the first place....</small>
