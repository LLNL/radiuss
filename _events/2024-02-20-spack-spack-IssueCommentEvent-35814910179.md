<small>Thanks, glad to hear! I had my experience from the conda builds with TF build fixes (not as in "I know bazel", rather the opposite) but as it can take a while; let's see! (also it's not just about the TFP itself, but TFP is a dep of zfit in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/42667 that I would actually like to bring in)...</small>
