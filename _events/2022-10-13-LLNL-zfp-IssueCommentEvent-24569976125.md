<small>Hi, unfortunately there is still no pip package for zfpy as Github Actions does not provide M1 silicon to build on. While cross-compilation to arm64 on x86 seems to work, there is an issue with the subsequent linking/delocalization which we haven't managed to solve. If conda packages aren't working either, users of M1 need to do their own compilation at the moment....</small>
