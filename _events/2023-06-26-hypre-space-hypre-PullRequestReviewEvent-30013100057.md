<small>This looks good to me, @victorapm !  The only question I have is about the name 'hypre-ILU'.  The use of the 'hypre-' prefix seems redundant and we don't do that for any other solvers.  Simply using 'ILU' would still differentiate it from PILUT and Euclid.  But, let's see what the other reviewers think.  Nice job!  Thanks!...</small>
