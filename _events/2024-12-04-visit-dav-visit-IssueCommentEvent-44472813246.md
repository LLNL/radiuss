<small>FWIW, its sad but I think true that for a lot of our ascii-based readers the entire file is read and processed and the results maintained in memory on *both* the metadata server and on the engine and when its a parallel engine, each and every MPI rank of that engine. Worse still, in some cases, I think this even happens at database *instantiation* time which means if its a large time series, for *all timesteps* in the time series....</small>
