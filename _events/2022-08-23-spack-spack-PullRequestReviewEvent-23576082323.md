<small>I looked at this more and the side effects I am concerned about in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/31631#discussion_r927170914 should not be a problem. But I still think a refactor is in order, so I have added a suggestion for a TODO comment here. If you choose to commit it and the tests pass (assuming I formatted this right in the Github UI) then I'll merge it....</small>
