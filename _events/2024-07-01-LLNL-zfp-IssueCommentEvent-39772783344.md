<small>@frobnitzem Thanks for filing this issue.  We're aware of this; see discussion [here](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp/issues/201#issuecomment-1866151608) and more recently in #231.  I'm trying to figure out the original intent and how to correct this.  I have minimal Python expertise, so any suggestions would be welcome....</small>
