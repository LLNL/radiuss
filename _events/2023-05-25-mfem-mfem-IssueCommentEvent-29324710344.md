<small>Just like with CG, given preconditioner $M$ and matrix $A$, preconditioned MINRES can be viewed as applying MINRES to $M^{-1/2} A M^{-1/2}$ (which preserves symmetry). You can also (equivalently) view this algorithm as applying MINRES in the inner product induced by $M$ to the system $M^{-1} A$ (the preconditioned system $M^{-1} A$ is self-adjoint with respect to this inner product)....</small>
