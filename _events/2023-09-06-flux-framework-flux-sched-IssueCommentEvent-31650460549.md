<small>One random other suggestion. We typically autogenerate release notes from PR titles (since they are used by default as the merge commit message), so before a merge the PR should possibly be titled something other than  "Cmake revert checks"  (which admittedly I'm not sure I understand what that means). Maybe just "switch build to cmake"...</small>
