<p>variable weight LinearForm</p><small>I am solving a 3D electromagnetic problem with 2D ports on the boundary that have known field distributions but with unknown weights.  The goal is to solve for the 3D field distribution plus the unknown weights at the ports.  A typical boundary value problem with known boundary values leads to the Ax=b problem, for which you have the FormLinearSystem method.  With unknown weights, the problem becomes something like Ax=a1\*b1+a2\*b2+..._aN\*bN, where ai are the unknown weights and bj are known.  Setting one weight to 1, say a1 for discussion purposes, leads to Ax-a2\*b2-...-aN\*bN=a1\*b1.  In matrix form, this could be...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3518' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
