<small>Yeah the formatting is definitely messed up in a few places, the main thing I want to make sure gets done (other than tests) is renaming the struct from hostname to `hostlist_hostname` so we don't accidentally squat on something so generic externally.  Let me see if I can get to it in the next couple of hours, if not the start of next week is crazy enough that I'd greatly appreciate the help.  I also want to check this version with sched, if it works out the way my microbenchmark did, the sched use-case should be ~10x faster with all of this put together....</small>
