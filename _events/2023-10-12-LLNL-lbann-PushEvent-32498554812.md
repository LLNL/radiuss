<small>Fixed the testing for the last mini-batch size so that if a data
reader was going beyond the number of iterations in the epoch, it
would return a zero size mini-batch.  Added checks to make sure there
were no attempts to fetch data for these cases.

Added tracking to count when a data field of a sample was distributed
into the model.  Temporarily issue a warning if there are unconsumed
fields in the I/O buffer.

Temporarily disable all background data fetching and use only
synchronous fetches.</small>
