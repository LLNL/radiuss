<small>The idea was to intentionally shadow the function from the standard library, so no changes to the codebase are needed and also the MFEM developers do not need to know about existence of the wrapper (almost "automagic" :smile: ). If this infrequently used function caused a conflict in the user code, it could be easily resolved as compilers are clear about what is happening. However, if compilers complain even about hypothetical conflicts or there are excessive conflicts for some reasons, CamelCase is probably the best solution :+1: ....</small>
