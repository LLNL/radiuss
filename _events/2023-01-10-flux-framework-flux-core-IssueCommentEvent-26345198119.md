<small>I think that something like this would work if the `flux_pragma_begin`, `flux_pragma_end`, and `flux_pragma` aliases were recognized and parsed by the `flux mini batch` command directly rather than requiring users to track and source the `flux-pragma.sh` helper script in all of their job scripts in order to use those aliases. I can see the value of having the user delimit where the pragmas are in their script to avoid confusion with comments and parsing, but I think that the `flux-pragma.sh` would just be an extra step for the users that would lead to confusion and errors....</small>
