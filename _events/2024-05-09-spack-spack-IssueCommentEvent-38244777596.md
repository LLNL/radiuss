<small>I'm a bit confused. What I found in the [nvidia docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/hopper-compatibility-guide/index.html#building-applications-using-cuda-toolkit-11-8) as well as this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28933055) is that 11.8 should support Harper / SM_90 / compute_90 capability. And if fact, `mpich 4.1.2` seems to compile just fine with `+cuda cuda_arch=90` after reverting this PR...</small>
