<small>As I am working through this and marking the slide surface I am not sure what would be best for Visit.  To be honest,  The slide surfaces are just materials.  They should have been "parts" but that may happen some time in the future.  As Visit reads in the elements it will need to check if the element is defined as being part of a slide surface or not.  As we cycle through the classes around approximately  line 1074 in avtMiliFileFormat.C.  I can provide a marker via makemili_driver for the materials to mark them as surfaces and whether they are master or slave.  I would not want to start listing the cells in the json file as it can become a database size read upon init and we are trying to avoid that.   ...</small>
