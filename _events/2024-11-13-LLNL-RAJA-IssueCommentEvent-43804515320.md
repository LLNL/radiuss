<small>@rchen20 something is wrong that I haven't figured out yet. Configuring with the previously installed version of the compiler (using rocm 5.7.1) dies during compilation with the same error. So I don't think it is an issue with the new version of the compiler you built. For some reason setting `BLT_CXX_STD` CMake variable, which we do in our build script is not propagating correctly....</small>
