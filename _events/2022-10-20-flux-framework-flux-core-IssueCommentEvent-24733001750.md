<small>Just pushed with some refactoring to support a URI for topology creation that can fit with a (future) plugin scheme for topology generation.  In this PR there are two "builtin plugins", one called  `kary`  and one called `custom` for the parent directives in the bootstrap.hosts array.  Probably we need to allow the topology to be set either on command line or in config....</small>
