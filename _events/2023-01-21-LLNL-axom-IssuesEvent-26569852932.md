<p>MFEMSidreDataCollection does not like to read a field.</p><small>When writing a CI test for IntersectionShaper replacement rules, I had been trying to save an MFEMSidreDataCollection that included volume fraction arrays. These were mfem::GridFunctions allocated using code that I don't recall modifying other than splitting it out into a method. The following program makes a MFEMSidreDataCollection like what might be seen as output from the IntersectionShaper and writes it out and then reads it back in. On readback, sidre claims that the fields do not meet Blueprint standards. So, is the data wrong before writing it out? There was no apparent failure during Save(). Or, is there a problem in Load() that messes up these fields?...</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/axom/issues/1007' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
