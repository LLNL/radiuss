<small>NVIDIA's documentation [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-compatibility-guide/index.html#application-compatibility-on-ampere) answers these questions. Note that what they call "cubin" the CMake docs call "real" and what they call "PTX" CMake calls "virtual". They say all kernel versions are baked into the same binary, and object loading/possible JIT compilation occurs when a particular CUDA kernel is first launched. Not sure how different kernels are treated. Never used HIP or SYCL so I can't provide advice there, sorry....</small>
