<p>flux-uri slurm:jobid needs a retest</p><small>Note to self: while working on https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-core/en/latest/guide/start.html#starting-with-slurm and running flux instances in the LLNL quartz debug queue, I was unable to get `flux uri slurm:jobid` to work. I didn't run it down.  This needs to be revisited to see if it really works and I'm just doing something dumb or if something's gone sour in that code....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/5482' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
