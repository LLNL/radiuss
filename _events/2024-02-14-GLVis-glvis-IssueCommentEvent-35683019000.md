<small>> Actually, I think the action that creates binaries is this: https://github.com/GLVis/glvis/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml. This action builds macOS and Windows binaries and uploads them as artifacts, e.g. see here: https://github.com/GLVis/glvis/actions/runs/6814543178, at the bottom of the page -- unfortunately, the artifacts are kept just for a short time, so the binaries from that build are not available anymore....</small>
