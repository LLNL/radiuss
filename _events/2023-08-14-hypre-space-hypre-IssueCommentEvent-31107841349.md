<small>Thanks, @drew-parsons! It's still a bit weird that you experienced the hang with your machine, which has enough CPU cores for running the test. I suppose that doesn't happen with mpich? I'm afraid I can't help further with this issue, but hopefully the pmix/openmpi folks can provide further guidance?...</small>
