<small>@ChristosT @c-wetterer-nelson Just FYI, if I compile `warpx +catalyst` in Spack and try a [3D catalyst diagnostics](https://warpx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataanalysis/catalyst.html#visualization-catalyst) I get an insta segfault once it reached the diagnostics step. Something we need to debug independent of the packaging here....</small>
