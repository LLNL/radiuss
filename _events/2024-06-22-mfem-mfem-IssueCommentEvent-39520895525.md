<small>We don't have an example of this, however, it's quite simple to implement based on Example 1: one just needs to add the appropriate weights from the spherical change of variables to the coefficients of the bilinear and linear forms. You can find the weights e.g. here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system....</small>
