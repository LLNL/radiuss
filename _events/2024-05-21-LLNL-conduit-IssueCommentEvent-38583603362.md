<small>I noticed that the current dual pyramid polyhedra example is incorrect for VTK client code. VTK assumes all faces surrounding a polyhedral cell point outwards.  For the current blueprint to work any shared faces between polyhedral elements need to be duplicated and reordered to give the correct orientation but this significantly increases the size of the dataset....</small>
