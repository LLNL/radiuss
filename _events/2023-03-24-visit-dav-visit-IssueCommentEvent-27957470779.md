<small>If you recall the STL files we wanted to create on VisIt are the result of reconstructing two-dimensional image slices captured using Micro-ct scanning of a 3-D object. In this case, vascular corrosion cast. I don't know if 3MF software is capable of that type of 3-D reconstruction.  Maybe you are thinking that VistIt will reconstructive 3-D objects to a 3-D model with an 3MF format?  ...</small>
