<small>While you are at it, you may want to remove stanza on custom CUDA installation from the README file. The workaround described there pertains to older versions of CMake and it is probably misleading for anyone with a reasonably recent CMake. See [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html) for more recent CMake target names for CUDA libraries....</small>
