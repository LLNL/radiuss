<small>@iaae assuming that `maxthread` in your code is larger than 1, what you are doing seems correct. Also, setting the env variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to your desired number of threads should be enough. If this is still not working for you, I would suggest you to write a minimum reproducible example (MRE) so we can take a look....</small>
