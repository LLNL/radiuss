<small>So, I feel like I kinda sorta understand this dataset now. Every domain has 26 neighbors. Thats 6 face neighbors, 12 edge neighbors and 8 vertex neighbors for a total of 26. Ordinarily, only domains wholly internal to the problem would have 26 neighbors. Thats most of the domains in a problem like this but domains on the external boundaries, edges and corners would have fewer than 26 domains....</small>
