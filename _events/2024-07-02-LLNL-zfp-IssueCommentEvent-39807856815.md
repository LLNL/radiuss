<small>@JanLJL Thanks for your contribution.  Let me begin by pointing out that we're in the midst of making significant changes to the CUDA (and HIP) implementation on the `staging` branch, so we likely would have to manually merge any PR you submit now by extracting the relevant extensions to 4D.  It may make sense to hold off until the `staging` branch is in better shape.  This branch will eventually be merged into `develop` (hopefully in the next couple of months); maybe then we'll be in a better position to pick up your work....</small>
