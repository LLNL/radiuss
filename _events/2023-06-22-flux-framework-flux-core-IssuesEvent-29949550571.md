<p>python: add convenience function for `job-info.lookup`</p><small>While most users will go through `job-list.list` or `job-list.list-id` for their job data needs, some more advanced users may need to get R and jobspec, such as `flux-accounting`.  So it'd be nice to have a convenience function for this instead of calling the RPCs directly....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/5176' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
