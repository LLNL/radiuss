* This release has a couple of known bugs.
    - The rendering of transparent geometry is incorrect when rendering in scalable parallel mode.
    - In rare instances a single pixel width horizontal mesh line will disappear. This can be fixed by changing the view or image size slightly or switching to a thicker line width.
* We are currently working on more binary distributions. They will be added as they become available.</small><a href='https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/releases/tag/v3.4.0' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
