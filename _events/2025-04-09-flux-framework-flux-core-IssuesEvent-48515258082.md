<p>run multiple tasks per gpu with `flux run`</p><small>A user would like to run 4 jobs on a node, with each job having 24 tasks and 1 gpu (each node has 96 CPU and 4 GPU). The `flux run` command line options will let a user specify multiple tasks per gpu if they are using a whole node (`-N 1 --gpus-per-node=1 --tasks-per-node=24`), but `flux run` doesn't appear to offer command line options to ask for multiple tasks per gpu without also asking for the whole node....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/6757' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
