<small>Hi, everyone. Is there any update on this? I reported this memory bug to the petsc developers a while ago. Now beyond the original Euclid smoother, there is a good motivation that I want to add the hypre's AIR preconditioner option into it. I would guess it will have the same memory issue if I just do it naively. ...</small>
