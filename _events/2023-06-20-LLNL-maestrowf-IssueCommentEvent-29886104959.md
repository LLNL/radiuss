<small>Oh sweet, python access to that would be cool!   Also, just realized lookign at your original ticket that this might just be a version parsing issue too given you appear to be using some sort of 'local' or 'pre-release' version number here rather than the likely expected length 3 tuple of a release version -> the '-225-g53e087510' bit on the end.  That being said, we should be able to trivially use python's built in parsing to fix that since pep440 knows how to deal with those already, enabling easy >=, <=, == comparisons in here....</small>
