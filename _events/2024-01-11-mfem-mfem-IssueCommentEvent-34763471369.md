<small>This is really awesome! Great that it supports vectors of different sizes. I could see this being a big win when, for example, you have a lot of parallel or constrained operators and each one no longer needs to store it's own internal temporary l-vectors for the local multiplications. It should work with nesting as well, as far as I can tell, like for `P1^T P2^T A P2 P1`....</small>
