<small>Actually, you were correct- apologies. Whatever you set OUTPUT_PATH to will actually be the parent directory, but the resulting value of `OUTPUT_PATH` will be `OUTPUT_PATH = OUTPUT_PATH + /<prefix>_<date>-<time>`. It would probably be good to include that in the docs section on `OUTPUT_PATH`....</small>
