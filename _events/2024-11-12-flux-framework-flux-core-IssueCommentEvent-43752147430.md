<small>We should probably give some INFO for `priority=0`, but maybe something slightly different like `PRIORITYHOLD`. Since `flux job urgency` already uses the `hold` alias it's natural to assume that a job in a `HOLD` state can be released with `flux job urgency ... default`, and I assume that wouldn't necessarily be the case for a job with `priority=0`....</small>
