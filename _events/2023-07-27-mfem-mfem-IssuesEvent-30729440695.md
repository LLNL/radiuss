<p>What does <element/boundary attribute> in .mesh file mean?</p><small>I'm working on making my own mesh file. I found the format of the mesh file in the [glvis document](https://glvis.org/mesh-formats/#:~:text=MFEM%20mesh%20v1.0%20This%20is%20the%20default%20format,edges%29%20or%20complicated%20%28curvilinear%20and%20more%20general%29%20meshes.), but I don't know what the format means by ```<element/boundary attribute>```. Its role does not seem to show up in the model....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3796' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
