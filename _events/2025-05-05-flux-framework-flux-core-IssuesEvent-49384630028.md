<p>Suggestion - add an indication in `flux jobs` when results are truncated</p><small>Current behavior is that e.g. `flux jobs -A` will return the first(?) 1000 jobs and then exit, without a user necessary realizing that there was more output to be had, since the `-c/--count` command isn't necessarily advertised unless you read the help.  Adding something like `1000 results returned - 1312 results omitted` as a last line would at least provide hinting that there's more to be seen....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/6794' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
