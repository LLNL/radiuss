<small>I don't think we should do a small PR to main to update the CI since that would pollute main, which should only contain merges that reflect the release history. Let's do what Chris suggested. @bmhan12 please verify that the RC branch works on a TOSS system with gcc8. Then, we can turn off the branch permissions on main and merge the PR....</small>
