<p>Bookmark potential integration target for ZFP</p><small>I happened to run across this [C/C++ stream io utility suite](https://ncbi.github.io/cxx-toolkit/pages/ch_compress) which apparently already integrates zlib, gzip and zstd and I am thinking it could be a potential place to integrate ZFP as well. I suspect they are doing only byte-level compression in their implementations and not doing *numeric* and/or array-level compression but I've always wondered what it would take (either in the way of stream manipulators or whatever) to extend C++ iostream interface to support ZFP compression....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/zfp/issues/193' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
