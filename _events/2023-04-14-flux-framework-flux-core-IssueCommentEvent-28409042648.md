<small>Had another idea, the `queue: foo` entry is redundant whenever there are jobs to display. So how about just putting `No jobs in queue foo` in the job list window when there are no jobs in the selected queue. Then we don't have to clutter the bottom summary line with the queue that will be almost always unused or redundant....</small>
