<small>@brugger1 I tried double precision option under `preferences` and I still see similar results. I have placed the new vtk file `mesh_log_dens_double.vtk` with double precision in the same [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O8fYTw-0hNzBWjkSFu2Knnz_1vCiOiJT?usp=sharing). I have also added a density field to the vtk file that I have in the mesh and while plotting it, I see columns of dark lines close to the minimum in the X-direction. I had discussed this issue with Dr. Pugmire at ORNL, but we couldn't find a definitive reason for such behavior in visit....</small>
