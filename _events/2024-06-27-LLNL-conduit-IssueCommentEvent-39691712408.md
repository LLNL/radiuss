<small>The left image reminds me of VisIt being stupid about mesh lines with PH zones. It looks like you have some non-PH zones that it gets the right mesh lines on and then some PH zones where it omits the mesh lines because of how the original zones logic works. Passing up VTK_POLYHEDRON for the zone eliminates the mesh line problem....</small>
