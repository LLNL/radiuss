<small>@garlick I might need some of your expertise on the cron/faketime issue.  Somehow I'm getting correct faketime for everything but `flux cron tab` in the cron test, but if I try to use `faketime` the executable in that spot to check it, it correctly reports being in a faketime environment.  I have a vague recollection we had some issues with it before, but it's striking me as absolutely baffling.  Might just be my brains still not all here, but I'm lost.  Still looking into bookworm....</small>
