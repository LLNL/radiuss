<small>Ok, so I've also run under valgrind two different ways. One way, I define expression `foo=ElementBlock` and in the other `bar=ElementBlock*1`. PC plotting `foo` works fine and no valgrind errors. PC plotting `bar` has valgrind errors two of which I quote below. Valgrind logs also attached. Still digging....</small>
