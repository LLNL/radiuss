<small>I made a bunch of changes and also implemented the read routines (symmetric, constant, and variable).  I tested one symmetric matrix that had both constant and variable coefficients, and it seemed to be read in correctly (printed it out and diffed with the original).  However, the struct driver dies and I think it's probably an unrelated issue (with the driver) that I will have to debug....</small>
