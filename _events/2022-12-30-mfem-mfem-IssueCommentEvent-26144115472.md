<small>Thank you for your response. I tried defining a new `Coefficient` class for `f` using the example code above and in the corresponding `Eval` method I try to return `n(i)`, where `i` indicates the direction that the load is applied. However, I get a convergence error when trying this: `Newton solver did not converge`. Do you have any suggestions on how I could resolve that?...</small>
