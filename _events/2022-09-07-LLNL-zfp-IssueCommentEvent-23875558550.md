<small>I know very little about Fortran, but my understanding is that STOP does not necessarily return a value (the PGI Fortran compiler just prints the value of the STOP argument, for instance).  It turns out that `ctest` can check for a regular expression in the output via `PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, which would solve this problem.  I added a new issue #179 to explicitly deal with our poorly written Fortran test....</small>
