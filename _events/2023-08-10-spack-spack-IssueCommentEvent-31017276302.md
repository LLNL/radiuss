<small>Thanks @tldahlgren if you mean the browser refresh button, I've tried that several times to no avail. If you mean a github button, I can't find it. Perhaps it is waiting for the various checks and prechecks to complete before updating the conflict section and hence diffs? Given that [commits](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/39126/commits) are updated I don't think there is anything else I can do at this point (other than getting dinner :rofl:)...</small>
