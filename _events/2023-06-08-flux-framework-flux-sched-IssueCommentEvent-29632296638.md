<small>Yeah, I don't think that will be all that bad.  I'm a bit confused how that can happen, since everything is called in the right order, but if we have a reasonable reproducing test case this should be relatively straightforward.  Glancing at it I'm guessing it's something like the list of queues in the initial config got cleared or some generated name changed or... ðŸ¤·   If we add in a bit of context to figure out which queue is missing and which queues exist it should fall out quickly....</small>
