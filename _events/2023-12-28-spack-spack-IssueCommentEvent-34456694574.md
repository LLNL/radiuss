<small>@haampie we made all stable versions preferred in PR https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/29514 when we added experimental release version 1.13.1. The 1.13.x versions were all removed after 1.14.0 (followed by 1.14.1, 1.14.2 and 1.14.3) were released. Do we no longer need more than one "preferred" version? Or at most one each for 1.14.x, 1.12.x, 1.10.x and 1.8.x?...</small>
