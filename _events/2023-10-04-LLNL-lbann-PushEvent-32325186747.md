<small>Bugfix user build (#2338)

* Fixed the user build script to get new files.

will not allow external packages to be built if they are found.

Tweaked the concretizer settings to allow minimal build dependencies
based on feedback from the Spack team.

Added openssl as an external to find to avoid known build issues.

* Disable the duplicates strategy until it is supported.
