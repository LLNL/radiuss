<small>I am using a clang 10 that was built against gcc 8.3.1 (rather than the clang 14 on this system that was build against gcc 4.9). That said, VGM is a pretty specialized component that shouldn't be involved at all in the pytorch build process. I'd be surprised if the pytorch issue depended on the VGM build....</small>
