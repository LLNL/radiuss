<small>Mac OS UUID virtual: platform-specific virtuals not correctly prioritized (#43002)

`apple-libuuid` includes types that aren't available in other `uuid`
providers; this cause issues in consuming packages (e.g., py-matplotlib)
that use SDKs like CarbonCore.framework when they attempt to use
`util-linux-uuid` as a `uuid` provider on Mac OS.

Tweak `util-linux-uuid` to indicate that it does not provide `uuid`
on Mac OS.</small>
