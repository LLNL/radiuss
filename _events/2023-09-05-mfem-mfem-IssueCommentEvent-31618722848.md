<small>> @mlstowell @dylan-copeland @pazner @IdoAkkerman the pull requests mentioned in the PR description are all merged, so I think we should be good to go for this miniapp as well. I have added something small to the PR description and have done a bit of cleaning up on the miniapp itself. The continuous integration check is failing, and I do not understand why. I think it is just canceled and would probably pass upon restarting the check?...</small>
