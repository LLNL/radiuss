<small>Also, I wonder if partial cancel, if needed, is going to help here. When nodes are lost, the job manager does not shrink the Rv1 assigned to jobs using those nodes. Therefore, when the `final` cancel is eventually made by the job manager, it will include resources in the shrink set....</small>
