<small>I'm surprised to say I'm on the fence.  If we can do it with existing facilities and without having to add a new state to track, that would be nice, and it sounds like the partial cancel plus remove should do that.  That said, it seems like the lost state might be useful for long-term down nodes. Maybe worth getting some feedback from Ryan or someone on if that would be a thing admins would want?...</small>
