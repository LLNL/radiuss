<small>@cmisale: I have a mostly working implementation of building `main.go` with autotools. I also added a simple check to make sure the output is correct. I needed to drop timing-based measurements from the output because that makes error checking difficult (how do you choose how much of a time difference qualifies as an error?)....</small>
