<small>This falls into a gap we don't really model at the moment.  If it's building statically, and doesn't use any of the LLVM tree at runtime, then `build` really is appropriate (or as close to it as we have).  The question is if that's really how it is though, does it look for headers, other library components, utilities, or anything else at runtime?...</small>
