<small>Heh, Tom's way is way better :) and has the advantage of 1) not having to reinstall every time the manpages change, 2) not having to install dependencies just to get Makefiles for the manpages, and 3) taking less time. I just threw what you suggested in my `.bashrc` and it works great. Thanks @trws!...</small>
