<small>Sorry I'm late for the discussion. One nice thing about a `flux policy` command would be that it could be expanded over time to include other limits (e.g. from flux-accounting). That said, I like @grondo's suggestion above of adding limits to the output of `flux resource list` with an implementation that would allow an easy `flux policy` command at some point in the future....</small>
