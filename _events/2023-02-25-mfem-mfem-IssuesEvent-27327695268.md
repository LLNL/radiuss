<p>How to get the matrix of the gradient for a ParBlockNonlinearForm? </p><small>Hi. I am new to mfem. I want to extract a submatrix of the gradient for a ParBlockNonlinearForm. I find that the gradient is returned in ParBlockNonlinearForm::GetGradient(const Vector &x). However, it is a BlockOperator class which I could not find a method that could directly extract its submatrix. Although I could achieve my purpose by multiply this BlockOpeartor with some vectors ei which have only one nonzero element using Mult(), it seems inefficient. Is there any elegant way to achieve my purpose?...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3509' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
