<small>This looks great @garlick.  When discussing some of the results with Bronis earlier today he brought up the idea of trying a binomial tree to see if we get better barrier and broadcast etc. performance out of the overlay.  I think we can try that with this without any modifications as long as the leaf depth doesn't need to be the same for all leaves....</small>
