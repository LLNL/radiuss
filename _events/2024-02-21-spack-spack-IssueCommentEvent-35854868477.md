<small>Some of these changes undo work in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/29246 which fixes a build error for Mac OS on https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/26559. I could try building with this PR on Mac OS to check that. @Chrismarsh It would be good to know what system/variations you built....</small>
