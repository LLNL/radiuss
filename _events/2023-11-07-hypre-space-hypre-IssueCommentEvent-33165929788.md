<small>@valonbb Yes EUCLID's ILUT can only be used sequentially, unfortunately. Curious, are you using the block Jacobi option for EUCLID or the default parallel ILU option? I am still surprised that HYPRE_ILU does not work for your problem. Are you able to share what the structure of your system looks like?...</small>
