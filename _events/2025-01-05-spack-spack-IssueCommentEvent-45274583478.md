<small>> @vvolkl Do you know if this package is still being used? Michelangelo Mangano, https://theory.cern/roster/mangano-michelangelo, is the original author (see link to the dead page at the bottom of his profile). Maybe you happen to know him? Or maybe this is somewhere on gitlab.cern.ch (but I cannot search site-wide without a cern account)....</small>
