<small>@LiquidPT I'm sorry to hear that. With the PR inflow we have it's not unusual to have a few days between interactions. In any case, see https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/42748 which adds conflicts to `petsc` and `ginkgo`. That should hopefully fix the build failures in our pipelines....</small>
