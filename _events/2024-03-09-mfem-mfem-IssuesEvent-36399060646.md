<p>A example of wave equation with time-dependent inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition</p><small>Hi everyone, since there's no example for problems with time-dependent (especially nonzero) Dirichlet boundary conditions, I try to write one based on `ex23`. A special nature of `ex23` is that wave equation has 2nd-order time derivatives. The code is as follow and I cannot guarantee it's correctness yet. I have some quesitons about improving it....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4182' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
