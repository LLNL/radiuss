<small>@pazner I didn't dive into the details of why I got an order of magnitude slower with mod/div on CPUs, it could be that I'm benchmarking this single threaded/single rank so compute time is disproportionately represented. I can try running the benchmark with multiple ranks to see if increasing memory bandwidth utilization helps to reduce the impact of the mod/div....</small>
