<small>This is causing me a big problem with dependency resolution with [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/). It causes a lot of unnecessary checks when generating lock files. It causes an explosion of dependency resolution checks and takes an hour to generate a lock file (instead of 5 seconds). Suprisingly, sometimes it even conflicts with `numpy` requirements from `matplotlib` and the lock file generation fails....</small>
