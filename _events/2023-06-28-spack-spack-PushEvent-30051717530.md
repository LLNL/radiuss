<small>Windows: Add PowerShell env support (#37951)

PowerShell requires explicit shell and env support in Spack.
This is due to the distinct differences in shell interactions between
cmd and pwsh. Add a doskey in pwsh piping 'spack' commands to a
powershell script similar to the sh function 'spack'. Add
support for PowerShell-specific shell interactions from Spack
(set/unset shell variables).</small>
