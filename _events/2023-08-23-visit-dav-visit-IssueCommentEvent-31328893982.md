<small>I looked at the output from an AMR run in Flash-X and the output hdf5 file has `cooridnates`, `bounding box`, `integer scalars` as keys which provide information on the grid. `integer scalars` stores the number of cells in a block in a given direction `n{x,y,z}b`, `bounding box` provides the array of bounds of a block, and `coordinate` provides the block centers as an array. Using these keys, the cell centered coordinate for each cell can be determined. ...</small>
