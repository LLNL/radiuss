<small>> For what it's worth, `freexl` was missing two dependencies. I have already submitted a fix in PR #46330. Don't think it's related directly, but in any case, you can see from the libtree output that freexl loads spack's libcharset.so.1 and libexpat.so.1, even though it may have been accidentally linked to system versions of those libraries....</small>
