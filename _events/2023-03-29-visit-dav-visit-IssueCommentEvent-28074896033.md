<small>> At the very least, what might be helpful would be if VisIt could take zone-centered 1D meshes and properly stair-step them automatically, instead of printing a stack trace. It may also be nice if VisIt didn't hide 1D meshes when reinterpreting them as curves, but instead allowed users the option to look at their 1D mesh any way they want....</small>
