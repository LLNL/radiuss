<p>LOR Solver: order 1 uses more memory than order 2 with the same number of DoFs</p><small>I encountered a strange issue when using the LOR solver with HypreAMS. It seems that it uses more memory for order 1 than for order 2 with the same number of DoFs, while the memory usage for order 3 is similar to that of order 2. This is unexpected, as one would typically assume that a lower order would require less memory. How to explain this behavior?...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4874' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
