<p>Question: `HashTable` vs `std::unordered_map`?</p><small>I'm looking at the `HashTable` presently, as I am attempting to add move semantics into the `NCMesh` class and a few other places. However the more I look, the more I am wondering why not use a `std::unordered_map` instead? This kind of thinking occurs in a few places in the library, where there's an stl implementation of a given type/class that is being reimplemented. My question is: why the bias against the stl? There's already `<vector>` `<map>` [included](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/mesh/ncmesh.hpp#L24-L25), and c++11 is the minimum standard version, which begs the question of why roll another hashtable? ...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3471' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
