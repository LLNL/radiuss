<small>I'd like to take this opportunity to share some thoughts on improving the organization of the `relion` package. As the number of runtime dependencies has grown, build time have increased too. I suggest introducing additional variants that would allow end users to enable/disable individual features as needed. This applies not only to the newly added dependencies in this PR, but also existing ones (e.g. `ctffind` which itself has a huge dependency tree). This could give users greater flexibility to customize their installations based on specific needs. ...</small>
