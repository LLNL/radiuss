<p>`detail::linear_winding_number` returns negation of true value</p><small>The winding number for a linear segment can be computed by only a single arccosine calculation. Currently, the non-interface implementation file `in_curved_polygon_impl.hpp` contains a method to compute this value. Currently, it returns the negation of the true winding number. This is currently not causing any issues in execution, as this method is only called by other hidden implementation methods, which account for this incorrect behavior independently. This makes this "misnaming" of the function low priority. However, if this method is ever taken out of the implementation file, as such a method could be useful in practical applications, it should be corrected....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/axom/issues/907' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
