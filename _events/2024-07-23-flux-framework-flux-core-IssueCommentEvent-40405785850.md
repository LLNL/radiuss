<small>Updated trace is quite different, this is a fake workload on my workstation where I start 10 workers that each run `flux resource list` 20 times sequentially, so 200 requests, for a 16,000 node cluster with all evenly numbered nodes drained (can't let it have big contiguous ranges). There are no resource updates during the test, so it's as cache friendly as possible....</small>
