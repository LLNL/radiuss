<small>> Is flux update an acceptable name for this command? It is kind of generic, but flux job-update might be inconvenient because other commands begin with flux job*, and flux job update won't work since it is convenient to write this command in Python. Also figured we have flux cancel not flux job-cancel so perhaps flux update is ok....</small>
