<small>Hey. Thanks a lot for the reply. I tried the above method by running the mesh-explorer.cpp code , but it seems to work only for Unstructured Grids. Does the method mentioned above, i.e. writing this piece of code, work with all other types of vtk meshes ? Also, it would be really helpful if you can elaborate on the program part, like where is the code supposed to be written and run ? ...</small>
