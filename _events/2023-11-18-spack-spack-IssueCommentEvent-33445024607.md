<small>Wouldn't it make more sense to add an --activate flag to create rather than the other way around as in this PR? The potential to accidentally clobber something when you were only trying to activate it would seem to be considerable if you do "spack env activate --create" instead of what makes more sense to me "spack env create --activate" which is a more natural step in a workflow....</small>
