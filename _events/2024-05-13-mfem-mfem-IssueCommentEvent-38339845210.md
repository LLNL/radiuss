<small>It's true, we don't necessarily need to stick with 3 letters. I'm not sure that `dpr` will be very clear to someone external. Maybe the abbreviations that will be immediately clear to most people are `fp32` and `fp64` -- this is also similar to `int32` and `int64` which is already used....</small>
