<small>> Hi @osborn9 . I just created the Spack PR for the new release, but to simplify things, I did it by editing the `package.py` file directly through the GitHub web interface. It was super easy to do it that way, but after re-reading your instructions on the release Wiki page, I noticed that you mentioned "changes to the configure options". That part was unclear to me. Can you elaborate? Also, do you recommend a different approach for creating the Spack PR from what I did this time?...</small>
