<small>The only build errors remaining here are `clingo-bootstrap` (see above) and the fact that numerous packages in the darwin-mps stack do seem to depend specifically on openmpi, and openmpi build hangs indefinitely for an as-yet-undetermined reason. If we can solve these, we can merge this and have our darwin pipelines back!...</small>
