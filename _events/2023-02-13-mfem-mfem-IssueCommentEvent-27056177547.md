<small>The initial geometry definitely does not need to be a box, the only requirement is that the coarse mesh is small enough to fit on each rank. It would be interesting to see your geometry, is it really impossible to mesh coarsely, so that the geometry is captured by at most tens of thousands of elements? Would curved elements help here? ...</small>
