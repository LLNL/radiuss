<small>> Thanks @ilumsden! One thing to note is that we [recently updated](https://github.com/flux-framework/rfc/pull/450) our [commit guidelines in Flux](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_1.html#patch-requirements). We've always required commit bodies in practice but now it's in the RFC....</small>
