<small>We'd previously discussed starting a spindle session at allocation time that lasts the whole allocation. That would also solve this problem. But the drawback is it's hard for users to pass configuration arguments to spindle, since spindle's session starts before the user gets control. Though I'll go this route if we can't do alternatives....</small>
