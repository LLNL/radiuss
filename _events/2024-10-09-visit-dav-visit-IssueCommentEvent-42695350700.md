<small>@markcmiller86 Thanks for the detailed explanation. Yes, I am aware of the difficulties in this workflow since I go through it almost every day (and perhaps have gotten used to the approach at the moment!). However, I like the suggestion to use the publisher model that queries the database for available entities and exposes only those. This way, the subset selection can be made simultaneously i.e., one could visualize volumetric and say edge fields simultaneously instead of opening multiple visit instances (which is what I do currently)....</small>
