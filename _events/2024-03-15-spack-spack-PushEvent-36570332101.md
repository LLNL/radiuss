<small>Clingo bootstrapping: Remove msvc constraint (#43199)

Patch allowing Clingo to build with VS22 has landed both in Spack
and Clingo upstream, update Spack's bootstrap constraints to handle
this.

Additionally, properly scope the patch application in the clingo
package to handle upstream patch.</small>
