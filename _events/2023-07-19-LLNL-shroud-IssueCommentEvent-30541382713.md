<small>I have managed to get the array of strings from C++ :) I have used the char** type. I had to concatenate all words as a single string (adding spaces for words with less than 4 characters) before passing it to Fortran. I do not know if it is the best way for doing this, but If anyone want to test/modify it I am posting an update for the code I have posted previously. ...</small>
