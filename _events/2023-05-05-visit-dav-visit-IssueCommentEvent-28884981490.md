<small>The testing @JustinPrivitera did here included a case where we ran parallel (not scalable or iceT) on a single processor...and still got different results from serial. This lead to the idea of another kind of test *mode*...we run single processor parallel and ensure it generates the same results as serial. If it does not, it suggests there are parallel code blocks that do not match their serial counterparts....</small>
