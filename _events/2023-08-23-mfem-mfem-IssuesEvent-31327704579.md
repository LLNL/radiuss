<p>mesh::Print does not output material attributes for NCMesh</p><small>I have a refined mesh using a modified shaper for plate w/ hole.  When I call mesh::print, the element attributes are not written.  I believe this is because  the NCMesh copy of it's elements does not have the attribute set.  When print is called, it delegates to the ncmesh print and uses it's element definitions not the user mesh.   Please correct me if I'm wrong here....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3839' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
