<small>@JustinPrivitera the best workaround I have found so far is to just create an alias expression and then use that alias in any further expressions requiring the original variable. On my mac with current `develop`, I don't get the garbage data condition then. So, in other words, define `foo` as an alias for `ElementBlock` and then define `bar` as `foo*1` and that works fine....</small>
