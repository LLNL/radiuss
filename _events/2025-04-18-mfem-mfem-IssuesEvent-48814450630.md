<p>High-order pyramid grid VTK output node index error</p><small>When using the `void Mesh::PrintVTK(std::ostream &os, int ref, int field_data)` function to output a pyramid grid as a VTK file, the refine function in `RefinedGeometry *GeometryRefiner::Refine(Geometry::Type Geom, int Times, int ETimes)` is employed. However, for the several tetrahedrons obtained by refining the pyramid grid, one of the node indices is -1. When outputting to VTK, this should be specially handled by duplicating it with another node. The current implementation results in the final output containing four elements with a node index of -1. For detailed code, refer to the following link....</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4815' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
