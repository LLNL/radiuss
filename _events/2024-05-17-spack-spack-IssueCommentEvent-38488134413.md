<small>Currently we test most heavily with gcc12+ and clang15+.  In principle gcc10 and 11 might also work, but I haven't done much work on ensuring that.  I have another fix that needs to go into this package later as it happens, as soon as this one goes in I'll post that up (it has to do with the version override code added recently)....</small>
