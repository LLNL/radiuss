<small>Spack does not care where example code is installed to, there are no customs in Spack of using that particular directory. Spack simply executes the build system of a package and lets the package decide where it should be installed. The `superlu-dist` package is currently hard-coded to run tests in that directory, but that can easily be changed, and even changed depending on the version of `superlu-dist`. So I don't think there's anything on Spack's side that is forcing `superlu-dist` to behave this way....</small>
