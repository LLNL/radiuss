<small>Just wanted to report in that I have Mark's suggestion up and running, and it seems to be doing the job.  I'm not seeing any issues with ill conditioning so far with the small test jobs I am running for now.  The needed custom vector coefficient for calculating n.E once turns out to be fairly simple.  Thanks for the tips!...</small>
