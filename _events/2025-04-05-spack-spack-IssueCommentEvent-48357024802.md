<small>For find semantics, and specifically python, I would not want a `spack find py-six%toolchain` to result in finding a package that can't actually be used by the tool chain. I.e. if the python implementation is not compatible with the toolchain. I would error on the side of `satisfies at least one and doesn't violate any`....</small>
