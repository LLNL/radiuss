<small>ok, looks like we need one last change: update the sphinx version in the lock file to get the rtd builds passing again.  lock file has it at 3.5, and would appear we need at least > 4.2 to support python >= 3.10.  unsure if there's any reason to pin it to anything earlier than 5.x, but it's not long for the builds anyway so up to you on the version....</small>
