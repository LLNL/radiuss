<small>Great, if you can reproduce that it will be much easier, I cannot, all tests pass for me. Probably because I use METIS 5. @j-signorelli , I agree with you that it might not be related to this PR, but implementation `GetEssentialVDofs()` is very simple. Nothing else than what you would do by hand, i.e., iteration over boundary elements and marking dofs if the attribute matches. Unless the mesh is non-conforming, have you checked that? (by `Nonconforming()`). Otherwise it is a bit of mystery ðŸ¤” ...</small>
