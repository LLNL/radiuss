<small>Windows testing: enable tests for installer components (#36970)

These tests now work without any changes to core. Furthermore, it is
surprising that they had to be disabled (at least, as long as the
installer.py tests are run on Windows: these tests are more-basic
and their functionality would have been exercised automatically).</small>
