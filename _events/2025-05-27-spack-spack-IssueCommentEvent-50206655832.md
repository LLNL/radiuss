<small>@wdconinc Thanks for your response and review. I thought I'd added the `libtiff` dependency, so I'm not sure why it's missing. I hadn't come across the `giflib` issue, which is also surprising since I have `builtin*` options turned off so it should have failed to compile. I'll take your word for it though, and add it in....</small>
