<small>@AlexanderRichert-NOAA : We had a user in the field hit this issue recently, which we've been attributing to the Arrow package.  However, since it doesn't seem to have an active maintainer, before spending more time on it, we wanted to ask whether the behavior we're seeing is at all familiar to you?  Thanks!...</small>
