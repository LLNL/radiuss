<p>Resource discovery on El Cap systems</p><small>On El Cap systems we will need a way to encode resource and scheduling information that also includes DWS rabbit information. From DWS we can get a list of compute nodes and rabbits, and their connectivity (which rabbits are on the same rack as which compute nodes). But we can't get CPU/GPU information about the compute nodes. So we will need to figure out how to reconcile the R from something like `flux ion-R encode` with the R that would be produced by polling DWS....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/919' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
