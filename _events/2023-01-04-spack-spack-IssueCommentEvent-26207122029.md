<small>Be aware that @haampie is doing something similar in #34784 but there he is getting the number of concretization processes to match with the cpu request.  He also did some profiling and found that about 1GB of memory per core is required for concretization (I'm not sure if that guideline is across the board or just for E4S), so the memory request is set accordingly in that PR as well....</small>
