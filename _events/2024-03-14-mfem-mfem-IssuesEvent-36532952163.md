<p>Finding corresponding DoFs in a mesh after symmetric operations</p><small>My research involves symmetry, so I have ensured that the geometry and mesh studied support some kind of symmetric operation. Taking a rectangular prism with its centroid at the origin of the O-xyz coordinate system as an example, I now have properties where both geometry and mesh are symmetric along the yz-plane. Currently, Attached is the mesh file. ...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4192' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
