<small>As I mentioned at the meeting, I think there should be some way how to specify what should be the interpretation of the items in `FieldDescriptor`. A finite element space can be used to obtain the physical space interpolation, which is the current behavior, but the same way one may want the reference space interpolation instead, for example. Ideally, there could be some customization available ðŸ˜® . Conceptually, these manually differentiated things could be outside of `DifferentiableOperator` maybe ðŸ¤” ....</small>
