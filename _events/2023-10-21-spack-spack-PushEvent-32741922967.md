<small>intel-tbb: patch patch for Apple's patch (#40640)

While e.g. GNU patch 2.7.6 (as provided by homebrew) would apply the previous
version of this patch without problems, Apple's patch 2.0-12u11-Apple fails
to find out which file to patch.

Adding two lines to the patch fixes that. Renamed the patch in order to
not require a `spack clean -m`.</small>
