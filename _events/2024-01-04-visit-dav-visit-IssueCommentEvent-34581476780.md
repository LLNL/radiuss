<small>@nDimensionalSpace is it possible to either `give` @markcmiller86 or @biagas the files on LLNL LC or, better yet, if its possible, attach a sample dataset that manifests the issue here as a gzip'd tarball for example? I understand the latter may not be practical, so `give` is fine too....</small>
