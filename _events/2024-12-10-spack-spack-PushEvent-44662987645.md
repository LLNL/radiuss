<small>Set the "build_jobs" on concretization/generate for CI (#47660)

* Set the "build_jobs" on concretization/generate for CI

build_jobs also controls the concretization pool size. Set this
in the config section for CI generate.

This config is overwritten by build_job CI using the SPACK_BUILD_JOBS
environment variable. This implicitly will drop the default build
CPU request on all "default" grouped build jobs from (max) 16 to 8.

* Add default allocations for build jobs

* Add common jobs and concretize args to ci generate and rebuild

* CI: Specify parallel concretize and build jobs via argument

* Increase power and cray concretization limits

Lowering limits for these stacks creates timeout</small>
