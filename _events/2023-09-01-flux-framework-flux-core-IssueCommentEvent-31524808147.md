<small>Yeah, although if slurm-agnostic (translates pmi2 API into wire protocol) not as bad as putting slurm's `libpmi.so` in the main library path.  Practically speaking, because we can't have nice things, these libraries tend to be specific to a particular process manager, so this is not too helpful....</small>
