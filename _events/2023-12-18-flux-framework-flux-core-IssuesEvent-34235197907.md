<p>Converting a CLI flux workflow to being Python based</p><small>Hi so I'm working on a python workflow as part of the ECP ExaAM project that's making use of [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) to optimize a set of parameters based on "experimental" observations. Currently, this workflow is done in serial manner where we make use of Python's `subprocess` call to run 'ExaConstit' on `N` number of processors. In the past, I've worked with your team to create a Flux-based workflow for a major component of the `ExaAM` workflow that made use of the CLI side of things. I found that that workflow worked fairly well on Lassen, Summit, and at some point I hope to test it on Crusher or one of LLNL's EA systems....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4325' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
