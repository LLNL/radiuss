<small>Thank you for your answer. I have read this article in conjunction with ex25 to see how to set up the PML region, but still haven't figured out how to set up my incident wave E^i in my computational domain, in the case you have set up the line source in the computational domain and set up the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary of the computational domain, so I hope I understand correctly. But in my problem, there is no source set up in the computational domain, I only want to set up the background field (i.e., the incident wave) in the computational domain region, and the function that I use to set up the incident field is as follows...</small>
