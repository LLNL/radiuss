<small>It occurred to me looking at this yesterday that there's something we usually don't see in our graphs in here, the cluster-level graph has nodes with a rack and exactly one node that's directly under the cluster vertex.  There's no reason that _should_ cause a problem, but I'm not sure it's tested....</small>
