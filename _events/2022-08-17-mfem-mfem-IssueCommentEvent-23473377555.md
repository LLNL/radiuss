<small>I do not want to find the integration point in a mesh. Actually, I am introducing another point on top of the finite element mesh, and want to use the introduced point as an integration point. I know the physical location of the introduced point and I can find which element the point is in, but I do not know the location of the point in reference space. ...</small>
