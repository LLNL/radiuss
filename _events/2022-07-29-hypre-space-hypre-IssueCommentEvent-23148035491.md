<small>Maybe this is not appropriate to ask here, but since there is already some discussion going on in this MR, here goes. I'd like to extend PETSc interface which already handles (pseudo-)block Krylov method so that it supports your multi-vectors. Would you by any chance have a high-level example so that I don't have to go through all MR to figure out how things are working, please?...</small>
