<small>Slowly going through all of the GNUMirrorPackage packages and finding lots of fixable problems.  Rather than roll of those up into a single PR I'll be doing per-package PRs.  Will keep this open for the moment but will be closing it once the pass is complete.  If anyone else is having issues with Intel compilers drop me a line; I'm getting some experience in making them play nice....</small>
