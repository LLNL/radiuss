<small>> Can the logic here be explained a bit more fully? It looks like this has to do with spaces with `vdim > 1`. In this case, does `LumpedMassInverse` return the operator with size corresponding to `vdim == 1`? And are the variables like `ML_inv_ea` in the call `LumpedMassInverse(ML_inv_ea)` sized accordingly?...</small>
