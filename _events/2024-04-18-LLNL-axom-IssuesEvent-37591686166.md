<p>Find polygon by intersecting tet with a plane</p><small>@adayton1 requested a method to find the polygon resulting from the intersection of a tetrahedron with a plane. This would enable EL3D to use Axom to underpin their 2D ProE shaping. Typically, ALE3D intersects a tet with the plane z = 0, obtaining a 2D polygon (dropping the z coordinate), then computes the volume of intersection of that polygon with nearby quadrilaterals....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/axom/issues/1324' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
