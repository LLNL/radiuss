<small>Hi @germasch - we looked into this as well and confirmed that it works in 3.14, but broke again with anythin newer than 3.18.0.  We have a different fix for this in the works here: https://github.com/LLNL/blt/pull/600.  Once this PR has been merged in to BLT, we will then pull in that later sub-module for Umpire....</small>
