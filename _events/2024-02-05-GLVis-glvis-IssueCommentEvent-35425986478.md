<small>I think I've tried every one of the colormaps from Fabio Crameri in grad school :'). A couple quick thoughts... colormap designers often emphasize linear luminosity (one of the main criticisms of jet is that its luminosity is nonlinear and non-monotonic) which is a feature that makes perfect sense for 2d data. However in 3d it can start to lose significance because there is almost always some kind of lighting applied to the scene. It is still a good thing to have, but IMO span of luminosity+color is more important in a scene with lighting. I like `batlow` and `lipari` from this set, as they are perceptually uniform, span many colors, and look good. I'm not a huge fan of colormaps like `buda` and `nuuk` as their range of color/luminosity is small, so scene lighting will more dramatically influence perception....</small>
