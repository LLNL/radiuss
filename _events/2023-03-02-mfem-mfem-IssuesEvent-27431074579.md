<p>2D possion eqution in FEM with MPI in 2 progress details</p><small> I cannot figure out the 2D  possion eqution in FEM with MPI. In case there are two grids,one is composed of point(1 2 3),two is composed of point(2 3 4) ，and how to solve the electric potential of point(2 3) x2 x3 in 2 MPI progress? while the x1 and x4 is given with ρ1 ρ4. ...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/3517' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
